Rattings,Reviews
5,"- I am using this laptop for about 15 days and if you need a future-proof laptop then this is the one.- The best part is the thermal system of this laptop, literally, this laptop doesn't heat up which definitely extends the life your laptop.- Almost all software available in the market is optimized to give the best performance with Intel processors and here you got the latest 11 generation intel i5 Hexa core processor.- The build quality is best, the design is awesome and the performance is powerful.- The typing experience you will get on this laptop is simply fabulous, better than Legion and Tuf laptop.- You can easily open the laptop lid with a single hand.- I use MATLAB and some CAD Softwares on this laptop which works very smoothly without any issue.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop. It lasts around 3 to 4 hrs for multitasking and heavy work.- Recently, I have upgraded my laptop to windows 11 which is working fine.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop."
1,I got a faulty product the charger wasn‚Äôt working and i ordered the 1tb 256ssd variant but i got 512ssd variant delivered which was faulty even thou on my invoice it mentioned the 1tb variant.
5,one of the best thermals out there intels new Alder Lake CPU with Nvidia RTX 3050 for smooth gamingpersonally using it and liked it so muchJust add another ssd for even better performance
5,Best gaming laptop in this range even after long hours of gaming it does not get much heated like the other laptops.  The display is amazing for gaming. Does not get heated fast can play for 3 to 4 hours without it getting heated.  Comfortable keyboard for gaming. The battery life is excellent for gaming laptop. I thought my charger was not working so I got in touch with the customer care and they were super helpful resolved my issue immediately actually the charger had to be pushed all the way it is a double push when it connects we hear a click sound.
5,"Loved this Laptop, Simply Amazing, Go for it"
5,"BATTERY IS A BIT LOW COMPARED TO OTHERS OF SAME PRICE BUT HDD AND SSD COMBO MAKES UP FOR THE LOSS, THERMALS ARE AWESOME.SERIOUSLY GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT BEST RTX 3050 LAPTOP, EVEN THOUGH THE TGP OF THE GPU IS A BIT LOWER THAN THE ROG STRIX G15, THE PERFORMANCE IS TOO BIG. HENCE GO FOR IT."
5,"Worth the money, if anybodys laptop is unable to charge up, remember to push the pin inside the charger port all the way in."
5,Super for gaming and editing

5,Good laptop
5,Good product
5,Love the Laptop. If you're looking for an excellent gaming laptop under 70k this is the best choice.
5,Good laptop at this range. Laptop speed is fentastic. And looking good with rgb keyboard and the buttons of keyboard are also good.
4,"Go for it, it's a nice pick."
3,"I am writing this review after about 1 month of usage. The specs can be looked at in the description. So, I will tell about the problems only. The keyboard spacing is not good. You will need time to get used to it. I am a programmer by profession. So, even though I know the key placements, typing errors are frequent. Touchpad's build quality doesn't look good. Also one needs to pick up the laptop with both hands, otherwise, some issues arise (like fan making noise). This laptop attracts dust, so need some measures for that also (keyboard cover). The battery is average (wouldn't have expected much as it is a performance-oriented laptop and 60Hz minimises the battery consumption). Many times, only 2 USB ports can be used (has 3 ports, but 2 are very close). The power point at the back also creates an issue (one needs to be extra cautious while charging). Sometimes, it gets heated even while using a browser and a media player and file explorer opened. So, it is an average product."
5,"Push charging pin through it will work , everything is fine in laptop nice  deal  good laptop üëç üëç üëç"
5,"1. First at all to every one i want to say do not think about bad reviews for this laptop because those bad reviews is not for its laptop those are 11300H which is 4 core 8 thread.And other for who got defective product (it is main reason for bad reviews) .2. Before buying this laptop i had done lots of research, wathing lots of video and the end i am confused with two processor amd (ryzen 5 5600H 6C 12T) and intel (i5-11400H 6C 12T in this laptop)CONCLUSION (this new intel processor beats  ryzen processor ) so that's why i choose this one.  ***************** Now about this laptop **************1. Everything awesome just go for it blindly.2. Performance 5/5. (base clock 2.7 and upto 4.5 ) ( 6 Core 12 Thread thanks god) ( Chace memory L1 480 KB, L2 7.5 MB, L3 12 MB always remember L1 chace is most speed ,powerful and costly)3. Display 5/5. (144 Hz)4. Build quality 5/5.5. Thunderbolt 4 and its wifi speed is fantastic (advantage..)6 Battery 5/4. (because it is gaming laptop always play game while charging it will give more performance and save your battery life.)7. Speaker 5/4. (yaa speakers is little bit low, but  you can  increase speakers volume by its dts software.)8. it's actual weight is 2.3 Kg not 2.4 i saw on acer offical site."
1,"I am highly disappointed with the product, the first time I got a faulty product it did not even start, after replacement the second one which was suppose to be 1 TB HDD but was only 500 GB.misleading information on the Amazon page.Waiting for my refund and return. I do not TRUST them anymore."
1,"Purchased laptop from Amazon on 3rd oct, noticed the warrant slip serial is not matching with laptop serial, complaint raised to Amazon, 15 days over even now the warrant slip serial is not changed. Now i purchased extended warranty along with this, i have booked the extended warranty based on the warrant slip serial. Now i have paid addtional 3,500 rs extra for some one laptop."
5,"Great deal at this price. Ryzen 3 processor is good enough to deal multitasking and running editing softwares. Got a free windows 11 upgrade which made it more fast and smooth. SSD makes it boot very quickly. The only drawback is RAM availability, only 6 gb is available out of 8, 2 gb is reserved for gpu."
5,"This laptop is awesome for students and teachers as it comes with subscription of MS Office. The screen and sound quality is very good. Battery backup is also great, the battery lasts for almost 5 hours. In battery settings, kept battery to its better performance, if we keep it at the best performance, battery drains out fast."
3,"This laptop is meant for students and working professional for meetings, online class,coding, excel work.Pros:--Laptop is not lagging due to SSD, AMD ryzen 3 is better than Core i3 generation 10 and some what to -11th generation as well.-Built quality is fine.-Lighter than Dell vostro 3401 and inspiron.-Camera is Decent.-Windows 11 working fine, no issues faced after updates-Sound is good.-Key board is good.Cons:--Hinges can be better.-Not meant for gamers.-Screen quality can be better, 220 nits of brightness."
5,"This product is a great one in it's range. The only dissatisfaction there might be from it's fan's noise but I guess it's there to compensate the speed of the CPU... Pretty fast working pc in it's range with SSD 256gb It works really well opens up really fast and it's a good choice if you're looking for normal stuff and little bit of occasional gaming or even some graphical gaming.. (only fan noise will occur at high processing). Keyboard is nice trackpad is also great and opens up really fast thanks to it's well adjust SSD and CPU speed. Fully supported for programmers, coders, businessmen, document editing, excellent for watching movies, videos and all other forms of entertainment... For video editors or gamers not a choice."
1,"The laptop received was defective. It never started without putting it into charging. everytime it started, the screen always remained black, the keyboard lit up and the fan's noise was audible too, but the display never turned on Amazon support was touchwood useless. They kept on postponing the inspection by a week and today the service got completed on its own. I am not even aware of how. Now i cannot return/replace it because a week has already passed."
5,"Perfect in this price range. Design looks and style are great. Fast processing with ssd. Just take couple of seconds to get you on windows. Best part, I got windows 11 update. Keyboard and touchpad are soft and smooth. HP has proven why people have a strong trust and hence one of the top on list. Thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. Got in just 3 days."
1,"The laptop received is defective stops working after a month, Amazon/HP not doing anything here. Also, the MS office installed is a trial version. Please don't believe whatever is mentioned in the product description and fall into their trap."

5,"Not for Gamers, High End Programmers, Multimedia Photo/Video Editors, CAD/CAM Users.Compactness and small in size is key feature that will amaze you.Recommendation1. Suitable for students2. Programmers can install lightweight IDE like VS code3. Don't think of installing DB packages like Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL Server as their process keep running which will eat up memory RAM.4. Ideal to keep this laptop if you have a high end desktop too. Intall big stuff there and work on either of your devices per your mobility needs. Like installing DB on desktop and doing development on this laptop.5. Heavy multi tasking is not recommended i.e. keeping many applications running in taskbar must be avoided. Plan your work and divide and concur. Open application that is needed now and close once done.6. Personal experience I keep Mail, MS Teams, VS Code for a 3000+ Java code files project, Few word and excel documents, Browser with average 8-10 tabs open and this doesn't lag.UpgradableRAM - no as this soldered to the motherboardSSD - Yes as this has NVMe PCIe Gen 3 SSD with M-key. Form Factor: 2242. The slot can also support 2280 SSD upto 2TB (I will post review once I upgrade)Best featuresDual band wifi5 ac protocol that gives immense speed and full utilization of my 100mbps connection.Touch and feel like a premium laptop, smooth finish, fine edges.Large keyboard keys doesn't feel clumsy.Enough large touchpad too.Goog battery backup between 4 - 6 hours depending upon brightness, process laptop is doing and WiFi usage while running on battery."
5,"1.Light weight, handy.2. Fast / good for basic multitasking3. Easy to use4. Suitable for travel and office/ student use5. Valu for money6. Battery backup.... decent**Overall ratings (4 to 4.5/5)**"
5,It's worth the price. The screen is not as big as it looks in the review pictures. It's compact. The keyboard is not cluttered and the OS is fast. Worth the cost especially if its your first laptop purchase.

5,"Tru value for money, this laptop is an ideal one-- smaller, lighter, speedy (slowed down wid upgrade to win11), aesthetics & appearance, efficient, RAM & HDD size etc.. excellent for normal usage, specially studies, data management etc...got gud deal wid exchange, cash back, no cost emi etc..Best delivery & shopping experience, all courtesy Amazon..Overall 5 star rating.."
5,"It was a 11.6 inch, I expected a little bigger size but this was a size of exact A4 sheet paper. The specifications was nice, had a cortona voice assistance and windows 10 OS already installed with 30 days McAfee antivirus and Microsoft office available. Good for normal office work and for students. Theüîã longed for 3-4 hours while I was usuing newly."
5,"Really serves my purpose of a very lightweight and small screen size 11.6‚Äù laptop with 30k range. There is a slight compromise on the HD Memory (256 GB) and Processor Celeron (Q4 ‚Äò19 release N series) which is understandable from the price. However, really works smooth for official work/ Students."
3,"Product is good.. Mother Board problem occurred after 10 th day of use.But, good service provided by Lenovo team at my location."
5,This laptop is light weight but not value of money. Screen is so small..I told it exchanges but amazon not help me...

1,"This laptop comes without basic, m.s. office, which ends up giving every year cost of addtional 5000 plus to use this laptop"
2,Laptop bag missing
4,"The performance is very good and it is fast. All features are good and as per the cost price, it is value for money, can't expect more for this price. However, the webcam resolution is a bit weak not giving a sharper picture but all in all, can't complain. I suggest going for it."
4,this laptop is good no problem so far i can use this for work but i can't use it to play games it stutters a bit but no problem with old games :) and no problem while doing work for the price i gave you guys i think its not bad! good work üòÄ
1,Ear jack is not working while inserting the ear plugs. Can it be justifiable.
3,"Package is almost open and deboy not coprate, and company also play game with me, regarding window 10 ,here no any app window, exale and note pad work.. Company  promise to give window 10 but not pre  installallation mother given any hard copy and soft  copy link.. Why cheat with client. It's not good... It's is a dabba without window 10...."
1,I purchaded this laptop 3 months back and since then it is very slow. Now to my surprise camera stopped working which is very rare for a new laptop. My kid is not able to attend the online classes i followed up with lenevo many times they are extremly slow after long follow up they said we accept cam not working and we will let you know when a new camera available . No sense of urgency or apology even they know how important classes are for kids now a days. Neither Lebenvo not amazon helps
3,"I do not like to write comments which can reduce a sale or hurt a business but this was absolute necessity... Bought this product in march, as I needed for lectures. But this laptop disappointed me, I do not do heavy work on it just browsing and using word files... It often hangs and slows down... Sometime microphone not working, done uninstall etc. etc...it works then in urgent situation it fails.... To make it clear, I am good with computers... I wonder what will happen with the people with very general knowledge!!‚Ä¶ What else disappointed me was, no reply from customer care... as due to pandemic there was not so much possibility to  visit Customer Services. I have many files and daily work I wonder now I just have to keep it, because worry about loss of my time..."
5,I bough this for my wife for online classes. This is a budget buy and the product looks superb. She is very excited and using it since then without any issues.Its boots faster as it has ssd and the laptop has a censor. So when ever you opens the laptop it boots immediately without any lagging.Thank you amazon for providing such a beautiful piece of craft.
3,"It just a replacement for Tab and Mobile. If you are looking this laptop for Kids school purpose or office purpose then its processor is not so upto the mark. You cant keep multiple big file, multiple application  open and do video chat. Yes but its good if you want to have limited use like web surfing or need key board who are not comfortable using tabs."
5,Bought for my 3 year old online class. It works perfectly for that purpose and I don't use for any other purposes  just zoom meetings for daughter and little bit browsing. It's broad for my kid to view the camera. Speaker sound quality is average only. Light weight and suits my purpose
5,"review after continue use 3 month , it is celeron, but SSD, so processing fast , no hanging and supported all latest application(s) for online classes, sound dolby system super, . keyboard very flexible. but camera not good."
1,Post 20 days  reviews:Suddenly screen  turns black and then blue lines appear while online classes are going on. These all started 20 days after receiving. So the return window is gone.Good screen size and good internet connection. Moves bewteen tge tabs easily.  The keypad is swift. Good for attending online classroom.
3,"Good Product light and large screen. Available at less than Rs 28,000 from other sellers but sold for Rs 33,000. Amazon and seller MaxIT not recommended for buying laptop buy from other sites after comparison."
5,Awesome product.Super light weight.So fast. Awesome speed @Wifi.Audio quality is pretty good.Worth money.Good for online classes!!!
3,"This laptop Only basic usage.Display View angle are wrost,Sound is Good.Battery backup Nice."
4,For moderate coding you can use this laptop.I will not recommend it for gaming.For daily home use it is fab.Ssd storage(only 237 gb) makes its operation fast.
5,Don't think about other reviews I also thinked about and I had confused but it forcely ordered it it is very good product and so many reviews has a issue that there is no sound quality . For this issue u want to change the Dolby audio settings it is good for gaming .value of money don't think about another reviews just buy it picture is suprb it is very light weight (slim3)
4,All are good but Adapter slot is not a fully insertable one. Only 1/3 part of adapter can be interested that is why almost part of memory adapter is seen outside.
5,Its a laptop with all required feature to get started and just value for money go for it and you will like it.. Thanks fforFree for such amazing deal
3,Slim n thin laptop for badic daily use.. battery is average drains fast
1,Total rupee waste please every one don't by it product this is very low quality product and ms office not working not excel not word any one not working in the laptop all wastage...
4,For the price of the laptop it is very good.
5,Its battery backup is awesome. Not good for gaming. Its camera not good. Its trackpad is good
5,Awesome product
5,The boot time is minimal. I am using it for online classes for my kids.
5,Its value for money at this price for online school.my daughter is injoying her new laptop.it looks very slick and the keypad is also smooth in touch. because of SSD it's fast .
3,"It had great configuration for the money, but the speakers were too low volume and I cross checked with the similar model which had better sound. I informed the seller and they asked to reach Lenovo service with the warranty. But the centres here said no to online purchase warranty. Still trying to fix this."
4,"Value for money, sound quality is good. Display is not full HD."
5,I buy this laptop but in some software it's not working.some keys are also not working like F1 .........F12.pgup pgdown not working excpet this it's best laptop inthis price.
1,"Having worked with Acer, Dell and HP, wanted to try Lenovo and was disappointed as the machine was painfully slow from bootup to shutdown.Ordered a replacement and still the same. Going back to tried and tested HP.Update : problem occurred with HP too, was told the issue was unavailability of SSD. After installing SSD, HP machine was fast, maybe that was the issue with lenovo too"
5,I LIKE THIS LAPTOPTHE PROCESSOR IS ALSO FAST AND GOODBUTTHIS LAPTOP HAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM OF STARTING IT TAKES 3-4 MINS TO STARTBATTERY CAPACITY IS BETTERIT GETS DISCHARGE FAST IN DOING CLASSES OR PLAYING GAMESELSEIN DOING PERSONAL WORKS THE CAPACITY ENOUGH1 TB IS VERY GREAT IN THIS LAPTOP IN USING ALL SOFTWARE
1,Service given for installation .. I dont even know if it's in good condition .By the time this guys fix the installation service by then my exchange date would have been missed . No point in buying like this expensive stuffToo worst service on installation andnpoor packaging . I don't know if I got a right stuff. I was waiting for the installation guy to open the box
1,Defective product not starting
3,"As far as Laptop functionality consideration its working just fine but at the same time its accessaries also same importance , without charger/battery you can't operate  the laptop. Laptop charger stoped working and some liquid like contents from it started burning. Having no nearest service centre, It will cost me extra to buy new Charger. Company should provide well tested and good performing accessaries."
1,"Laptop Stoped Working in 1 Month and ""NO"" Support"" what so ever; Amzaon sends us to Lenovo. Lenovo has worst support system; initialy we were happy but as it stoped working and, we are strugling to get support from either Amzon or Lenovo.Will ""STRONGLY"" recomend not to buy, as it may be best product but of no use if it has no proper after sales support"
1,Got the one with better config. Hangs way too much though I haven't installed anything yet. Takes half hour just to start. Not sure what's the problem but it annoys me too much.Better pay bit more money and buy a better one from other brands.
2,Laptop is looks thin and light weight. But initial performnce is very low and not act as an 8GB ram.
1,"Several Features Issue & No one is ready to resolve the issue, Under 2 years warranty 3 players are passing the issue on each of them, End-user is the one who has to suffered due to technical and installation failure"
1,"I am disappointed as I have found it very below my expectations. In the very first week, it is behaving as if infected by virus. It does not have the common features I have enjoyed in other computers."
1,"It takes so much time to boot up and apps take long time to load, even after updating she software the issue remains same, its been month since I returned the order and i did not receive my refund."
1,"Overall very slow in performance, poor built quality, advise not to go for this, by the time I could return this the due date was over. Given for service."
5,I like the build quality but the charger is very ordinary.
1,Third class laptop charging problem and charger hitting problem please return
1,Laptop camera is not working since day one and Lenovo support team denied on site support asking to go to service center. What's is the benefit on buying this product through Amazon.
5,With that cost this product was amazing in Amazon. Thanks üëç
1,Worse of the money. Never ever buy it. If it's price will be 20k then also don't buy it. Very bad in everything.
5,Awesome laptop
4,"Well built & faster than HP, battery backup is satisfactory. Overall one of the best laptop in market in this range"
4,It looks very professional and its light weight. I have been using this for past 2 months. The laptop has become slow.
4,The camera is lacking in Google meet and is slightly slow but overall it's good n great.
1,The brand and members which send this product they are not working on to improve the rating of their company and products. I received two times a laptop with keyboard issue.
1,Please dont buy this product.. this laptop is not working and there is no support from Lenovo to replace it.
5,Nice
5,Good to goo
4,Speed of the laptop doesnt seem like it have a 8gb ram.. moreover like a 4gb ram laptop only.Other functions are good and okay..
1,From the I purchased this product we are getting blue screen
5,"A sleek compact light weight beauty. Going to surprise you how small it is yet it has an adequately sized 14 inch screen.Pros:Beautiful display, narrow bezels.Fast - thanks to SSD.Quite decent speakers. Clear and almost loud enough.Instant and effective face recognition.Good battery life - I get a good 8 hours atleast.Keyboard is quite responsive.Cons:Mousepad gets laggy like once a day and idk maybe it's a driver issue but got to check that."
4,Love how sleek and compact this laptop is. The speakers are great. The picture quality is crisp. Perfect for someone who prefers compact gadgets. Can be easily compared to Apple‚Äôs MacBook Pro.. and that too at half the price.. Haven‚Äôt been using it much though.. will post a detailed review soon.
5,"The ASUS ZenBook 14 UX433FA-A6113T has great looks and performs well as a lightweight laptop. I have had no problems with its functioning yet. The only disadvantage I see is the short vertical aspect of the screen, which can be a problem for users accustomed to larger screens. Often, the lower parts of popup menus are difficult to access. Also, its not easy to turn on the numberpad on the mousepad as the on/off button does not work well."
1,"I bought this laptop a year and 1 month ago.  at 4 months I had a problem and needed technical assistance, okay they fixed it.  Yesterday the battery icon started showing 255% charged (as if that were possible), it can't identify the battery anymore and I can only use the laptop plugged in. Do NOT buy this laptop, I saved my money to buy it and I am extremely upset üò¢"
5,"Great value for this price. Adapter overheats a bit. Touchpad felt a little gimmicky at first but after the the new firmware update its working well. Screen is too glossy and reflects a lot. But still it gets pretty bright,the colours are sharp and crisp and it's a great device for media. Speakers are awesome, can get very loud while maintaining the clarity. Battery life is great. It can comfortably pull off a whole day at work ( you don't need to bring your charger with it).It's slim,sleek,light and the metal frame is a delight to hold in your hands.Would recommend it over any other product in this range of price."
5,I have been using this for last one year and observed following issues:1. It has a very weak wifi signal not even 5 meter.2. Extreamly weak Bluetooth signal not even 2 meter.3. Touchpad button used for numeric key is worst. Once you turn it on hard to turn it off.I would not recommend this product to buy.
1,Within two months the computer is hanging.  It appears that some keys are stuck up
1,The laptop gets hang again and again it have been just 6months and haven‚Äôt used much but whenever i use it gets hang
5,"If your need is light weighted laptop with basic functionalities, then nothing in market can beat this laptop. I would definitely recommend it. My life has become easier after buying it."
5,Good Laptop with the superb metallic build quality.Specs are outdated in the present scenario but sufficient to support daily requirements. Boot time is less than 3 seconds.
5,"This is the seventh laptop i bought and the best so far. I have bought  Mac pro, Lenovo, Hp, sony, LG and IBM earlier."
1,Product delivered is not as per specification s .Very disappointing
4,Its very handy. very nice laptop. superb configuration. looks attractive.The touch pad is very broad and keeps coming in a way while typing. Little inconvenient. you should check it before buying. Little irritating as well. Can work faster due to it.
4,I tried to contact the reseller for some commercial enquiry. Not friendly to share any information
5,Best laptop in the price range. Incomparable smooth performance. Just love it
4,It's pretty good.
5,"Superb performance, good look and finish"
4,The camera was defective. Had to return the product.
5,"Very good, smoothly"
4,Very good product
4,"Hey everyone, I got this like few months back and I have been using it for pretty much everything like gaming, productivity, programming, watching movies , web browsing etc. This one never let me down. But still there are some issues which I think needed attention, so sharing the quick pros and cons below:NOTE: I bought the i7 version with graphics card for around 83k on sale with bank offer, so yeah I got it at a good deal.  You can also give these HP laptop a try amzn.to/3jXmm2N its similarPros:========================Superb display with infinity edges (very less bezels). The build quality and design is just so gorgeousfast to boot and flies on day to day tasksSpeaker sound quality is usableFace unlock works 99% times and its quick. Even in dark scenarios it works well.On Moderate use you can get around 8-10hrs of battery backup, heavy use will last for like 4-5hoursSmooth keyboard, easy to type though keys are cramped============================Cons:==============================Sound is not loud as expected, anyway I always use it with my bluetooth speaker.Mousepad is a bit laggy at times and the overall experience is bad. I prefer the trackpad in my xps laptop.below average voice recognitionBecause of its design this laptop feels so fragile, I am sure it will not survive a drop. I already have dents around the edges (I work at a DC, so I keep moving around with this laptop)================================VERDICT: FOR SURE YOU WILL NOT FIND A LAPTOP OF THESE MUCH FEATURES IN THIS RANGE. but the trackpad can be a bit troublesome if you are not going to use a mouse at all. Anyway give this HP laptop here  a try amazon.in/gp/product/B07NMSWFS4 , the trackpad here is much more usable and overall a good package."
4,Regarding harddisk it should be provided 1TB and it provided with ms office for this price this as my part of requirements
5,A gpu would've been nice but when you look at it nobody plays games in an ultrabook so it's perfect
2,"Ya Ya83,990.00 For 2 years old laptop üòè"
1,TOTAL WASTE
1,Never buy asus zenbook ux430ua...Its the worst product you can get.It have consumed lot of my time..Its been not working properly since the firat day i bought it....And the service centres are very poor...Never buy the product if need a good one
2,"Laptop is decent. Problem is that the Acer Swift 3 (SF314-55G) comes with a i5 8265U, 72% NTSC panel, an SD card reader and MX 250 which undoubtedly is better than Ryzen integrated GPU. However, this laptop's screen is very washed out, colors lood really bad and unfortunately the pricing is almost 25% more than the variant I consider better. If you can't supply a good screen, it's a pointless laptop for me. Anyway, the Ryzen 4500U runs everything smoothly, this variant has 45% NTSC, no SD Card reader, slightly better keyboard, really bad speakers, wifi 6 is there but again, we're not ready for it...I would not recommend to buy at this price point, wait for it to go to 45k like SF314-55G before purchasing."
1,"4500u is not worth 59k in any sense without touch screen, or GPU."
3,"Laptop stopped working after 2 days. Gets restart by itself again and again. Acer customer care is not approachable, amazon laptop technician failed to turn up. I had finally returned the laptop, thanks to Amazon. Will look for cheaper products only again.Screen was dull., otherwise specs are good for this laptop. There was some manufacturing defect causing the laptop to restart again."
5,Perfect for students.
5,"Awesome laptop for its price. Wish it had better screen, better backlighting on keyboard and option of Ryzen 7."
5,"After one week of use , I can say that this is an excellent laptop in terms of build quality, design, performance etc. This is defenitely a value for money laptop go ahead and enjoy the performance of ryzen 4k"
1,The laptop started malfunctioning within 1 month of purchase.Issues faced1. Fan is making excessive noise2. Earphones or headphone are not detected easily3. Screen quality is bad so colour displayed is different4. The paint started chipping off within 1 monthThe acer customer care technicians replaced the fan but still the noise persists. They have said there is mother board issue but it has not yet been replaced.Pro1. It is light weight2. Copy speeds are fast due to the solid state chip
3,"Everything is great such as battery life, keyboard, processing power except Display quality which is not good and peak brightness is also very low.I choose this because it was only AMD 4000 powered laptop at the time of purchase but now we have other options so please check out others before buying this."
5,"Everything is good except for the mediocre display. Performance is top notch, no heating issues, excellent battery life (7 hours easily) and a premium build quality. The keyboard is pretty good too, the keys have decent travel.Bought this for 62k and I don't think there are better laptops at this price range. I know it's expensive but maybe wait for a price drop. Don't go for the Intel one, I prefer this one for regular usage."
5,"The one and only con : screen is not very colour accurate, and not super bright if you plan on working in the sun.Other than that, this laptop is absolutely amazing in every single other category. I'd recommend watching Dave2D's video on it.I'm so glad I bought this. :)"
3,"Performance wise, it‚Äôs good. Display is also ok. But Sound is very underwhelming, even my iPhone sounds louder. Very disappointedüòü"
5,Good laptop for everyday use. I am not fond of gaming. I use it for coding and everyday tasks for which I am very much comfortable with this laptop. Battery life is very good. Feels so light as it just weighs 1.2 kgs. AMD Ryzen 4500U processor is very powerful. Overall its very good.
4,"Still, i feel like it's overpriced maybe. With no thunderbolt or gen 2 ports. Average web cam. Great sound with dts sound support. Fast, metallic(and also feels more heavy than 1.2 kg), fast booting and fingerprnt scanner . Had gapping bw the screen and the plastic cladding holding the screen, thus got it replaced. And also to mention , don't know why acer has not put a screen lens covering the camera sensor.Its all naked there."
5,value for money.
5,Nice laptop
5,Good product. Light weight. Nice speed.
5,Overall a great product for general use and basic video editing.
5,Premium look
5,"Light weight , portable and good performance for day to day tasks and good battery life."
5,"Wonderful laptop, best at every single aspect."
5,"Display- It's decent, not the best but it's good if you're not doing work that needs colours. (6/10)Build-quality- It has a all aluminum-magnesium chassis which makes it storng and light. It looks great. (8/10)Looks- It looks super premier with a metal chassis. The laptop is super thin and light. (9/10)Professor- It has an AMD Ryzen 5 4500U processor which is a champ. It 100 times better than the i5 version. I didn't find any major drawback except the fact that it gets a warm after playing heavy games which is totally normal. (10/10)Battery- Normally it gives more than 7-8 hours. While playing games it gives not more then 3 hours. With 20-30% brightness the laptop lasts for around 9 hours. (8.5/10)Keyboard- It is really good, the feel of trying is great. (10/10)*It switches on within 8 sec which is really fast. (Faster than Mac)*Finger print sensor is fast and good*Very light*61K is a little experience but trust me it's absolutely fine if you're paying this much for this device.Overall I recommend this if you want a laptop for office and college. Gaming is possible but it's not for gaming."
4,"My brother has this one. Good product with the latest Amd Ryzen 5. A good buy at this price range. If anyone tells it should be lower, tell them to go to hell because almost all the laptops these days with the same specs are of the similar price"
5,Laptop is verry good light weight no heatingFar better than i5 10th genLittle screen colour correction requiredPrice can be less wait for sales
1,ACER stop looting. This should be sold below 50k. Price is too high.The specifications are best for an affordable high performing machine. But the price is unjust.
1,"Decrease price rate , it's not value for money. Msi modern 15 is much better than this,  it's original price is 50k"
1,"Specifications and all are perfect in this laptop, but I've been facing BSOD error problems from the very first month. I've tried reaching service center several times but they never fixed the issue. This is not at all what you expect when you've spent 65k rupees on a laptop. Worst experience, never buying acer product again!"
3,It is expensive at this price. It should be under 50k. This is in my wishlist. But i cannot afford this. My budget is under 50k only. But i love this laptop. Waiting for good price ü§ûü§û
2,One of the most stupid deals. Price is way higher than normal this laptop does not worth more than 50k as its screen quality is worse just 40 %srgb don't buy
4,Very slow and not good 8gb ram  according speed very slow and hang bad laptop plz don't money west
1,Really hate the product. Its wastage of money. Its taking too long to start and its making a wierd noice in the background its too heavy and large and is not handy at ol.worst part is that they are not even ready to refund nor replace. Really pissed off
5,The Product Worth it
5,"I bought this laptop with 8GB of ram and 1TB HDD, and AMD ryzen 3 3250U with integrated graphics.This laptop is good for taking online classes and web surfing.Most of them are afraid of buying AMD processor's but you would not find any heating issues, infact AMD gives more performance with low temperature.If you are a person who is for taking online classes and conference, then you can definately go for it.If need for more performance, then add some 250GB SSD.I will update my review after 6 months."
4,"After using it from last 40 days, I have observed all it's aspects deeply.At this prize laptop looks premium. Amazing Design, I got latop with in 3 days  today. It has Magnificent Processor... Amazing Display.. Easy to use.  Battery is also Good. Smooth Touch pad. Overall a genniune Product for Educational and Business Purpose. Go for It.If you want to get more advanced product just add some SDD....Minnor Issue:- It's making some noise while running over internet."
1,A used product that was damaged was delivered. Absolutely appalled by this service & I can't believe a new product paid for in full was delivered in this condition
3,"Pros:Display quality.Light weight.Decent sound.Good performance as per it's hardware.Cons:One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated. Almost  2GB ram will allocated for Graphics. Felt like 4gb even it's 5.9gb usable.Design flaws are there, rough edges like unfinished .Heat vent is placed at bottom, so we have to keep alway on flat surface.Very thin bezel around display."
1,Product is low quality.within 3 days use the monitor gone blank. Also when use with internet it makes a lot of noise.Booting is pathetic and takes minimum 4 to 5 minutes.After paying so much amount and getting such quality is really bad.Would never recommend any of my friends or relatives to buy this anymore.Now waiting for hp to provide resolution.It is 4 th day but till date no update from HP.Amazon pls do not sell such low quality product at your site. People will ignore Amazone in future.Not sure if I get some call back or any replacement.
1,Very slow gets hang all the time..Same product same configuration my friend bought at store but not online..that product is working fine..and we both are using for the same purpose..Still this products is problematic and the product purchased at store is cool..
4,Looks good üôÇüòä
4,"I bought this laptop for my Son's online school. Earlier I had Lenovo IdeaPad (11 yrs old ), so thought to replace it. For General study & surfing it's prefect. But a few corns, which I have mentioned below :1) Bootup is slow, compared to my old laptop ( obviously, since no SSD )2) No on-switch led light, which Lenovo is providing in same models & cost3) limited USB port.. only 2. Lenovo is providing more USB ports for same models & cost4) The Keyboard text are not visible at certain angle. <45%. since the color of the text on the Key are very light. Lenovo has better Keyboard, which is visible from all angles.To get faster bootup, got with the model which has SSD or SSD+HDD. which is 5K-6K expensive. Or you can install separate SSD 256GB ( cost of SSD is hardly 2k-4k ).For no LED light on on-switch, there is no solution. Need to look at the LED indicator on the left slide next  Type C port.For limited USB port, buy extra multiple USB connect which is hardly 500 Rs.But, the biggest problem is the Keyboard Text visibility, not sure how to make it visible from all angles. If anyone has an idea or suggestion plz let me know."
1,"Often the screen turns to black screen and only cursor will move unable to see any application in the background. After sometime, the machine has been restarted, by the time all the unsaved efforts are lost. This issue has been recurred and reached Amazon to support. The technician visited and found the issue and he told there may be some software issue, and you can request for replacement. The replacement machine is also having the same issue and additionally one of the USB ports nor working. Since, I am using hp for long time, I got disappointed with this product greatly, Not recommended to buy this product. P"
2,Very poor performance speed . It will take more time for booting too. While click on browser or any apps it's respond very slowly.
2,"I have ordered this laptop for an online class ( Std V), basically to use Microsoft Teams. Team app is getting hanged frequently even after OS upgrade. I also called HP technical support team multiple times but they also not able to solve this issue. Finally, they suggested to upgrade RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB or check with Microsoft."
4,"Excellent product for Students. It has it all built in. Be it Windows 10, MS office life time, HD camera, High resolution display, 8 Gb ram, 1Tb HDD, High quality stereo speakers with good volume.Not tried yet for heavy games like PUBG, CS, ASPHALT etc.."
2,"I bought this laptop only for basic office functions like word editing and simple excel works. I kept my expectations low while buying it. But still this laptop didn't even reach those basic expectations. Its taking 4 mins to boot :( and work on updates forever whenever you try to shutdown or restart. I bought this relying on HP brand name and regretting now. Don't know the problem is due to processor or OS or hardware config, but whatever it is, the final result is worst."
1,"Purchased laptop from Amazon on 3rd oct, noticed the warrant slip serial is not matching with laptop serial, complaint raised to Amazon, 15 days over even now the warrant slip serial is not changed. Now i purchased extended warranty along with this, i have booked the extended warranty based on the warrant slip serial. Now i have paid addtional 3,500 rs extra for some one laptop."
5,"Great deal at this price. Ryzen 3 processor is good enough to deal multitasking and running editing softwares. Got a free windows 11 upgrade which made it more fast and smooth. SSD makes it boot very quickly. The only drawback is RAM availability, only 6 gb is available out of 8, 2 gb is reserved for gpu."
5,"This laptop is awesome for students and teachers as it comes with subscription of MS Office. The screen and sound quality is very good. Battery backup is also great, the battery lasts for almost 5 hours. In battery settings, kept battery to its better performance, if we keep it at the best performance, battery drains out fast."
3,"This laptop is meant for students and working professional for meetings, online class,coding, excel work.Pros:--Laptop is not lagging due to SSD, AMD ryzen 3 is better than Core i3 generation 10 and some what to -11th generation as well.-Built quality is fine.-Lighter than Dell vostro 3401 and inspiron.-Camera is Decent.-Windows 11 working fine, no issues faced after updates-Sound is good.-Key board is good.Cons:--Hinges can be better.-Not meant for gamers.-Screen quality can be better, 220 nits of brightness."
5,"This product is a great one in it's range. The only dissatisfaction there might be from it's fan's noise but I guess it's there to compensate the speed of the CPU... Pretty fast working pc in it's range with SSD 256gb It works really well opens up really fast and it's a good choice if you're looking for normal stuff and little bit of occasional gaming or even some graphical gaming.. (only fan noise will occur at high processing). Keyboard is nice trackpad is also great and opens up really fast thanks to it's well adjust SSD and CPU speed. Fully supported for programmers, coders, businessmen, document editing, excellent for watching movies, videos and all other forms of entertainment... For video editors or gamers not a choice."
1,"The laptop received was defective. It never started without putting it into charging. everytime it started, the screen always remained black, the keyboard lit up and the fan's noise was audible too, but the display never turned on Amazon support was touchwood useless. They kept on postponing the inspection by a week and today the service got completed on its own. I am not even aware of how. Now i cannot return/replace it because a week has already passed."
5,"Perfect in this price range. Design looks and style are great. Fast processing with ssd. Just take couple of seconds to get you on windows. Best part, I got windows 11 update. Keyboard and touchpad are soft and smooth. HP has proven why people have a strong trust and hence one of the top on list. Thanks to Amazon for prompt delivery. Got in just 3 days."
1,"The laptop received is defective stops working after a month, Amazon/HP not doing anything here. Also, the MS office installed is a trial version. Please don't believe whatever is mentioned in the product description and fall into their trap."
5,For online classes
1,Camera stopped working and it seems a refurbished piece
5,Absolutely a  beast at such a price range
1,This product is wrost I am not able to intall Ms office
4,Good morning
5,Value for money
1,Totally disappointed
4,Very good
4,It is good.
3,"I didn't get MS office licence activation key with this product. They mentioned life time validity. I got preinstalled ms office applications. When I open them, asking for licence. Not able to edit anything."
1,"Ho is most worst üëé laptop üíª most every laptop facing hange /lack issue plz don't buy this I strongly condemn to you this laptop is not fine are campare to value of money, I was buyed from the starting laptop facing hange issue  but battery is very best, plzzzzz i please to laptop dealer u have to make performance of this laptop this issue not only faccing me but this isbfacing everyone"
4,"Hello all, please wait a second and read this review before you make any decision.If you are thinking for a laptop and then buying this then my dear you are at wrong place.This is not a laptop this is basically a TABLET attached with a keyboard that's it."
5,"Before you purchase this, decide whether you can make do with a chromebook else you should go for lower end laptop.Performance, Looks and Build Quality are excellent. I was pleasantly surprised with how well it performs given the internals. I'm personally biased towards AMD processors and this time as well AMD did not disappoint.Performance in the converted tablet mode is also good, albeit the 16:9 ratio on a 14 inch screen does require some getting used to. All in all, this was a good decision for my use case."
5,"Almost all functions used in normal laptop can also be used in Chromebook. Simple & Best for home & office use. For this price, value of the product is high.Do not know about gaming capabilities yet.Pros:1) Instant Boot up.2) Instant shut down.3) Touch screen.4) Light weight (1.49 Kgs).5) MS office (For Android) from play store can be used.6) As an easy free alternative - Since Google have almost all applications, suh as Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides etc. we won't feel any limitations when compared to a normal laptop.7) Classic look.8) Have 4 layers of security.Cons:1) Disk storage 64 GB only. But cloud can be used for storage for further."
1,As detailed in the specifications there no slot available on the machine for expanding the memory by 256GB.. no feedback yet ! More over they won't publish the feedback even after 3 days! May be till the free replacement period expires ..they won't respond
1,The charger for the laptop is not working and I complained to HP the customer person said he has raised my request as dead on arrival. I should have returned the whole laptop and replaced as I thought the charger is the only problem let me replace only that I got into trouble.its been a month and charger is still coming without any date. My Case ID 5072569874 incase for HP to cross verify.UpdateI got my charger replaced now
4,"Looks and feels like a nice laptop, touch works great"
2,"THERE IS NO 100GB OF FREE CLOUD STORAGE AS SHOWN IN SPECIFICATIONS . Laptop shows not eligible for the service.There is no memory card slot as shown in the specifications, HOW DO WE EXPAND THE STORAGE TO 256 GB ??THE SMART LOCK JUST DOES NOT WORK WITH THE LAPTOPTHE HP SUPPORT SERVICE IS NOT CONTACTABLE .BATTERY DOES NOT GO FOR 9 HOURS.*I WILL WANT A REFUND FOR THIS PRODUCT*"
4,"Overall i would say if your ok with an average/sub-par display then this will not disappoint you !! it's extremely portable and easy to use for students/elders - does all the usual stuff like browsing, going through apps, web calls etc. It's not for hardcore work (coding/video editing, number crunching using ms office / high end windows softwares)Pros- Compact form factor.- Decent Built Quality, it's plastic but does not feel cheap.- Awesome battery life (10-13 hrs), mostly performs better than my phone and windows laptop.- Fast Charging (45 mins, 0 to100%), 45W Charger which is USB type C, and not like the usual bulky laptop chargers.- Specs are decent enough to support the OS, Apps and all rest of the functionality, the laptop is quick to load and takes almost everything u throw at it without really stuttering.- I think it's far better than a tab with the option of working as a full laptop and convertible to a tab which can do landscape/portrait modes like a charm.- Awesome backlit keyboard, feels way better than most of the windows ones in this price, also they keyboard gets disabled when rotated so no issues on keys getting pressed while in tab mode.- Liked the color options on this - it's matt finish and looks more expensive than it's price !Cons- Was very disappointed with the display, it's below average (extremely bad viewing angles, it's not an FHD screen). I do not think the display is justified at this price range (31K). This for me was the biggest con - and  honestly i am even thinking of returning it just for this one issue, we need to keep changing the angles in sunlight while in tab mode to read a news paper/article.- May be i have not figured this one yet, but when in tab mode if it goes idle - it does not come back on unless bought into laptop mode.- Speakers are below average, they are loud - but not clear (again thy could do better at this price)"
4,"Just bought one and trying out now.  I will add more details later.  Experience is so far, so good.One important issue though.  How do I claim the free 100GB google drive storage.  I tried to claim it from the perks site through google one but there is 'error from their side.'  Please help first."
3,"Classy product, sleek design, easy to carry. Best for budget.It is not meant for creative works like graphic design, video editing or gaming. You can still do all those, but the UI is not very good. Low RAM doesn't help either. Maybe okay for beginners who are worried about expense.Best for: StudentsUseful for office works.Battery life is good so far. Heats up a little, but that's expected if your network is poor or if you run applications that require high performance. Poor camera quality. Screen quality is just okay.If you're here looking for a chromebook (that means you accept that it is limited to certain features and completely depends on network) then you can consider buying this.I would suggest buying a screen protector along with it.Edited: I suggest looking for other Chromebooks and keep this as a last resort. There are better options  for the same price."
2,Video Player is loading.
1,"Please do not waste your money buying this  product , I got it with a lot of excitement but only after 2 days of deleivering and started using it started hanging in middle of work and it was impossible for it to get fixed soon. I waited thinking it‚Äôs a new one and it might be not something serious. But even after a week of use it still the same. If you are in a urgent meeting this product will surely put that on stake as after sometime people will stop hearing you. Most of the times even wifi connections goes and comes back which I never faced before this laptop ."
3,"The product is very good, boots up in 10 seconds and easy to work with. The serious problem I am facing is about compatibility with my HP printer (Laserjet M1136 MFP). Apparently HP has not bothered to produce a Driver for this model of printer to be able to be configured with Chrome OS, although over 150 other types of HP printers are configur-able. On top, the HP centre's problem solvers were simply clueless. Sad state of extreme deficiency of service. Incidentally, this printer was bought in 2017 end, whereas, my other printer bought in USA in 2016 beginning, they have a driver for it for set up. Hopefully, HP engineers will deal with this."
3,Pros :1. Touch Screen2. Speakers are good3. This laptop is only useful for kids because of crome OS4. Fast Opening and closing.Cons :1. Some of the apps like Hotstar not works perfectly crashes all the time.2. Storage is very less.3. Not all apps are available for chrome OS.4. Just a Tablet with keyboard not more than of that5. It's very heavy so no use of 360¬∞ rotation.
5,Amazing laptopBattery life once fully charged worked for the whole day.Touch is also good.Speakers are very good volume is loud and clear.Camera is ok ok.Keyboard is awesomeOver all best option in this range if you want both laptop and tablet. The flip is also good.It is a must buy.
5,"It's a good device and we'll built for its price. No if you are hesitant if comparing to the non foldable version of chrome book. Don't be it has fewer numbers of rating because it was recently launched. It's works great, haven't shown any lag and touch screen is also responsive. For the price all these features are good specially if u r comparing to the lower segment of windows laptop priced in the same range. Go for it you won't regret it."
1,I purchased chromebook on Oct 28 and today it stopped working. It is not powering on. Amazon has a policy for return of 7 days and HP has a policy of return 14 days. Only option available now is for the technician to fix it if it's a hardware issue. And I am supposed to live with a faulty machine.
4,Its good for students who do only classes...its just a big browser..like a big tab...but in this price its a good buy...again strictly would work excellent for students for online classes..
5,"Loved the product, first time user of chrome book, must confess, looks impressive, at this price 27k) it's a steal!"
3,"Good for those who wrok mostly on internet, storage is an issue, 100gb cloud storage is bluff, but great for study purpose watching movies and all( you will have to adjust your screen for best viewing angle)"
5,"U can have all ur favourite app.. whatsapp, Amazon prime, and many more.. But its interface is not at all same as other laptop.. but much more comfortable to use.. go for it if u have craze for touchscreen laptop with .. 360 degree flip...."
1,"No slot for micro SD , though company claim of 256 gb micro SD card expandable. So any one want for add memory ,it's not possible. Also no fingerprint reader in device."
2,"If you are used to regular laptops please dont but very uncomfortable to use. It is good only for browsing.Looks, battery back up, touch excellent"
5,Without thinking go for it
3,The resolution is worse than it was described. I'm adding a few bucks and replacing it with higher resolution only because I love the design of the entire HP Chromebook.
5,Value for money  for day to day basis usage no sd card slot . Battery life is best brightNess  also light weight very comfortable usage .
1,It does not have sd  card slot and it‚Äôs battery is local and it‚Äôs does working properly hanging app doesn‚Äôt work
5,Good product
5,Satisfying my needs .. good for kids education.. good if you are famailiagr and fan of android
3,build quality is good. worst screen on laptop in history of laptop screens. battery is long lasting.
5,Thing important to know is that first understand your needs then buy this laptop. It's good and does what it says.
5,"Absolutely worth the money....user friendly,  good battery life."
3,Did not like that I can‚Äôt use Microsoft office
5,Good product
1,I want use it as a personal laptop but it‚Äôs not worth it
1,Product received in damage condition and also quality of product very bad
4,Best lap for normal use... budget friendly...üî•üî•
4,Performance wise I am satisfied with the laptop after 2 weeks of usage. the only problems are:1) there is no ethernet port. so if wifi is not working then cant use internet or connect to network2) there is no led indicators apart from caps lock or battery charging3) usable RAM is only ~6G for the OS
3,I used it for my children's online classes. Over Heat and Hangs within 20 minutes. No other option except power off. I thing its not supporting high contrast and resolution. I returned and planed to bye higher version like i3 or i5.
1,Product is not upto the mark no use of this Its not Chromebook scrapbook
1,"This doesn't come with touchscreen, there is no return policy. You can only ask for replacement"
1,MRP 60000.00 seems Fake. Deliberatley done to show discount and to attract customers. Donot do such things.Please give genuine description.
5,"This laptop is perfect for home and student use. Don't get blindsided by the negative reviews. The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.Benefits:- Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal.- Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs.- Boot time: 10 secs switch-on & switch-off.- Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed.- Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube & many more from any angle of the laptop.- Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 40/100.- Touchpad: smooth.- Pre-activated Office 2019.Note:- Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.- As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.- In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know how to use it properly.- At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.- Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.- If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.- DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.- Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.That's all folks!!!"
5,One of the best product at this price....
4,Very good .... After use of 9 months (updated)
5,"Best laptop under 40k. 1TB HDD, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, Ryzen 3.No matter how much dig in you wont find these specifications in any other brand at this price."
1,Dear Team HPI purchased this laptop on 3rd July 2021. But warranty says it's valid only upto 13th June 2022. Can you please check and resolve?? Once I get the resolution I will share my complete review
1,"I got this laptop on 7-May  , we  use it only for online classes and no other software is installed  .  Every now and then , The laptop just stops working and hangs , happens atleast twice a day . Please do not buy this model."
1,"Always Online Products are having issues, after spending huge money for laptop we are not getting perfect item ,  this laptop mic is not working properly ,even creating disturbance to others while online calls ,  it is hampering online classes and meetings . My Voice not Audible to others ."
1,I purchased this 2 weeks back to use it for online schooling purpose. MS Teams and zoom frequently freezes laptop during meetings. I had to force the shut down to use it again .HP technicians unable to fix the problem. I am looking to return this.update after 2 months .. Issue is not yet resolved ... HP support team is unable to fix it.
4,Anti-glare quality is good although there is slight bit lack in screen brightness .....nd off course u can play games except if played in higher setting it get heatup nd fan sound high.....Overall it is worth buying in this price ....
1,"I bought this laptop and after 1 week usage writing this....Don't buy this laptop, it will hang frequently, it can not handle minimum application, if you open teams and attend meeting it will hang, you need to restart...that is only the option.."
5,"I was satisfied with the overall performance and speed of the laptop.  It works well with the WiFI at home and has all the requisite software needed for online classes.  The sound is especially clear with headphones.  The webcam is quite good and is sufficient for attending meetings and online classes.However, if you need to know in advance, the laptop does not have a BACKLIT keyboard.  It does not appear to be suited for serious gaming purposes.Thank You Amazon for the superb quality of packaging and prompt delivery."
5,"I got this laptop from amazon for 41.3 K INR. I searched for many laptops in this price range but did not find many who were offering the SSD+HDD combination with 8GB RAM and preinstalled windows and office softwares. I am using the Ryzen based system for the 1st time. The configuration offered in this price range is really great.I am using this laptop for a week now and mostly do normal computing activities, web browsing, watching movies etc. The booting up and shutting down are really fast...around 20 secs. The sound, display and battery backup are also good. The laptop is new now and lets see how things go with time. I think it is really worth buying this product and will recommend it.If it is helpful, I would like to mention one more point that while buying I had opted for exchanging my old laptop  to get some discount... amazon was offering 9.75K flat discount.  But since my old laptop was damaged a little in the hinge area and the laptop plastic body, the exchange offer got cancelled totally later during pick up."
1,"I useing a laptop since 1 months but the problem is my laptop automatically hang at time of work, so also if I play music some  frucal problem, that's why don't like"
1,Defective peice wifi not working properly
2,"I got this laptop for my kid's remote schooing. The laptop hangs with Microsoft Teams video calling. Everytime it hangs need to reboot the system. For all the AMD processor and the bells & whistles of speed, it could not handle a simple Teams video call.Additionally i found a slight dent on one side."
1,"New laptop not switching on.I am quitely disappointed.Dear HP improve your quality check and testing system before product reaches market and customerPoorest service by Amazon.I ordered,  defective laptop delivered, ordered for replacement,Wantedly miscommunication between delivery boy and technical person.Customer care executive made me helpless.Asked to cancel order and return.Amazon team made me to miss bank offer,Poorest service of Amazon,Amazon is not customer centric."
3,Amazon has sent the product which was defective. Unfortunetly amazon has provided wrong invoice.... pls check again may you have also received the wrong invoice. hp said give correct invoice or no warranty. I asked customer service they said provide photo and all and till now no  correct invoice is provided and my dead product of 79000 is kept with me. Daily calls with customer service and they were befooling. If invoice is wrong its a fraud technically....And now i realize some day we may  get into some legal issue....Update:- finally amazon provided me the correct invoice and after multpile hickups my product got returned... . it was done but very very late and i have noticed some customer service really helped me otherwise i would have kept the product as it is.Infact while returning also the person asked so many questions before return.Nothing was smooth....but yes money saved.....
4,"Pros-1. 16:10 aspect ratio with 13.3 inch screen(atleast for me)2. Good keyboard with proper spaces between the keys and decent key travel. Trackpad is large.3. Latest ryzen processor4. No heating problem at all even after using 4-5 hours of use with the charger plugged in.5. Metal body(except the lid which is plastic)6. Colours look good, black is deeper with good contrast and negligible screen leaking.7. Fingerprint sensor(nowadays it is available in every laptop in this range though)8. Upgradable to windows 119. 16 MB cache memory!!10. Could use the omen gaming hub if you want to play some heavy games on this(not recommended)Cons-1. Average battery life(around 5-6 hours depending upon brightness and type of usage, it can increase upto 7-8 hours too)2. Average sound( clarity is there but speakers are lacking in loudness, although more than enough if you just want to attend the online classes or attend meetings and listen to music, but you could face problems while watching movies in certain conditions)3. RAM not expandable(although it is enough to get the job done even in graphics intensive work)4. Wish it could support the windows hello camera. Also I would have liked to see a better camera which supports beyond just 720P.Conclusion:A premium build laptop with good display quality, very good for multitasking functionalities which can match mac book air with m1 chip for most of the tasks( incase you were wondering if you should buy macbook after coming this far in price point)It's not perfect but certainly tending to it."
4,"Light as a feather, looks sleek af. Price to performance ratio depends on your budget and usage. A tad bit expensive but fits me perfectly, do your research before buying it for yourself."
1,For a pavilion laptop with ryzen processor this laptop is grossly overpriced. The battery is just 43wh which gives you 5-6 hours of heavy usage. hp i5  11th gen laptop with 16gb ram is priced at 66k. Only change is aspect ratio and screen to body ratio.
5,"Super light laptop, only .97 kg and u won't feel like carrying it.. just like a notebook in ur hand.And the pic quality is amazing with true sRGB.Very good laptop for professional works like eclipse, Android SDK, Jmeter testing etc..I ran all these with heavy load input and it works without any problem. The AMD ryzen 5600 is amazing. Far better than intel i7 I felt.16GB ram with integrated graphics core is more than enough for anything else.Played Asphalt game with full options and worked fine.Am not a gamer hence didn't try other super heavy games.The screen size is perfect for me, 13.3"" is the best I like.i have 2 more laptops from hp, 15"" and 14""...but now am liking 13"" since it's very compact and easy to put inside bag along ur notebooks."
5,"The rose gold looks stunning ü§© It is the best ultrabook by hp.Performance - AMD 5600u can handle any task such as video editing, coding , ERP software etcDisplay - Best quality display no issues in outdoor and you can work continuously on it no problem for your eyes.Battery üîã: Battery backup is awesome. For coding gives 8-10 hr backup, entertainment such as watching Netflix, Amazon Prime gives 6-8hr, Multitasking - Coding + listening music + downloading any item + video editing then gives 4-6 hours.Keyboard - it is awesome typing experience is flagship level also the backlight is very good in rose gold color"
4,"Due to my work requirements, I need Windows 10 Professional (Remote Desktop and Domain membership), and the pre-installed ""Windows 10 Home - whatever"" edition could not be upgraded so I had to format it and install Windows 10 Professional from scratch, but formatting and installing Windows 10 Professional went without a hitch.The only problem I face is that the built in Realtek WIFI adapter keeps on losing the connectivity. I move from one conference room to another with the laptop, and even within my 2 floor home, I move from one room / floor to another room / floor with a different access point / router, it loses connectivity and thinks that ""No Networks are available"". Disabling/Enabling the adapter, Sleep/Wake up, Hibernate/UnHibernate does not work. But after full shutdown and reboot it finds the networks. I have decided to live with it because it is practically impossible to get any customer service with this product.So I bought one of those nano WIFI adapters for <INR 500 (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B008IFXQFU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1 )and stuck it in the SB Port, disabled the onboard RealTek WIFI adapter and things are ok now."
5,Good for those who are looking for a easily portable and lightweight laptop.This laptop can handle all the tasks smoothly except high end gaming and the tasks that requires high GPU  usage.Keyboard typing experience and screen quality is very nice.80 to 25 percentage drop in battery can be expected in about 5 to 6 hours under the usage like internet browsing and video playback.
5,"Really great laptop for students, ultra light weight for carrying around, good screen quality, great battery life giving nearly10-12 hours during various runs."
4,"A powerful laptop, but delicate structure"
5,Best price n light weight
4,Lightweight.Best performance. I use it for coding.All heavy software works fine.Looks premiumCons -Speaker sound is lowWifi range issue. Always need to keep laptop near router.

5,Good product for developer.
5,"Best for light gaming , programming, coding.and multitasking. very best for contain consuming or watching Netflix or videos.You must have to go for this."

5,Killer speed killer look
5,Excellent laptop. It is beast and highly recommend for gaming and normal use.
4,"this review after use of 5 days.1. somebody has written that above 1TB external HD can't be used. I have used my 5TB HD for transfer of data. It is well connected and data transfer  rate is good.2. Office 360 is temporary. hence I installed my Microsoft office which works well.3. Speed is little bit slow which u may not notice if single application has operated.4. PC operates at 50 to 70 % of CPU and almost 80% of memory which make little worried to me.5. I am also using it for delivering reports through service plus  and meeting. Till yet no problems. Installed java for that.finally, i can say as on date  that for this price it is a good laptop. Keyboard is not Bluetooth and yes removable. screen has good clarity and not having good viewing angle. Speaker is pathetic but it is ok in room. Mic is fantastic. As compared to other chrome based, I prefer it, as I have to operate it for digital signature and service plus."

5,"I really had my doubts ! But I was very wrong I if u are a mild user like me you can definitely go for it , It has all the functionality of a surface pro but not with a hefty price tag! I use it for my work and detatch it for entertainment you will fall in love with it ! Very compact and worthy got for it"
5,Great
5,Very good product at these price

4,"It would be better if Power point,word and xl are given permenantlyAfter free trial it asks subscreption to use them which is paid"
1,"Key board is not durable... Will not go above one month.. right side display is is not stick appropriately with body, even you can feel that by finger...."
4,Budget. Software and so mote. But storage is not up to the mark.Should be 128GB
3,"Speaker, mouse pad & keyboard issue.Offline service not onsite service.so bad. by mistake i bought."
2,I wanted to buy this for my sons online classes. Seems it is jot sufficient enough for zoom calls and also the audio is loud enough for classes.
1,"The product is overall good. But the keyboard is not work after 1 month. no onsite service available, service center is 150KM far from VAPI (GUJARAT)."
4,"Everything is brilliant, screen, battery performance, touch,"
5,Value for money. Windows 11 upgrade and works very smooth for daily work.
5,Backup super
1,My laptop is dead after 10 days. Don't buy it it's waste of money and energy
4,Very good laptop in this range of priceTouch screen is very good
3,"PROS1. Its touch screen2. it doesn't have any fans, so doesn't make a sound.3. model is very stylish4. best for studentsCONS1. it's not 360 convertible2. it doesn't have a screensaver option3. it has a storage space of 49 gb instead of 64 gb, but works fine.4. connectivity to bluetooth is slow5. camera quality is really bad6. doesn't support all android apps7. keys are dysfunctional but you can work around it."
3,"Pros1. Boots within 5 seconds (I bet u might have never seen anything like this before)2. ‚ÄúOk Google‚Äù assistant like Siri3. Easy access like an android mobile phone4. Don‚Äôt be fooled this is not a tab, can access all android apps. Some inbuilt paid apps available for free.5. Gives Macbook like feel, fast charging and superb battery.6. Best for business travelers, presentation speakers, online teaching, learning, browsing.Cons1. Less storage capacity (usable is around 45GB only) but online cloud storage is available2. Meant only for document typing and browsing purpose, nothing much you can expect other watching movies.3. Its all Google and Google only.4. Beginners will find it a bit difficult to use this. Needs a bit of practice.5. No LAN port available. Only wifi."
1,"Screen is not upto the mark at this price point! Bad viewing angles, can see only yellowish tinge from any other angle other than the front!"
5,"14a model chromebook is Touch screen and user friendly, no lagging observed. Supports all android apps. Camera is very good, have been using it for school zoom sessions.Cons:Keyboard is not backlit18gb occupied out of 64gb memory. So one need to use the memory card for extending to 256gb."
5,"This Chromebook is perfect if you are looking for normal browsing,streaming. OS is very simple and very quick. Does the job very well. Touch screen is added advantage. Cloud storage is unlimited. so no issues."
4,The laptop arrived in a good condition and it was packed well. But it didn't have any receipt or warranty card inside even though a one year warranty is mentioned on Amazon. Please get back to me.
1,"1. Build quality is bad in general, plasticky. There are MIL tested variants out there for same price. Screen is wobbly and the machine is not built for a drop.2. Speakers begin to screech at high volumes.3. Other NA series models had back-lit keyboards. I bought this without verifying. My bad. But for a non-back lit keyboard, the design is bad and the letters are not visible. Im going to need to find stickers.4. Track pad works great.5. Screen is mediocre.6. Battery lasts all day as the processor has low power consumption. Overall performance is as predicted."
1,Device is good looking and decent.The keyboard is plastic and flimsy and letters are not visible.Screen flickering on video calls or youtube and distortedNot all android apps are supported which is supported in android phone.Screen has vertical line issues
1,"Do not fall into the trap of buying this product, this is HP‚Äôs conspiracy to dump an inferior product in the name of a chromebook. Ideally windows laptop are supposed to be expensive because of the payout for the OS & hence Chromebooks are supposed to be cheaper. In spite of this arrangement this laptop feels cheaper than a 25k windows laptop with probably a bigger screen. My mistake of trusting a brand like HP blindfoldedly. Not to mention the pain of dealing with a defective product on top of it."
5,"Update after using for 6 months.Works very well. No issues. Chrome OS has grown on me. All the deficiencies I felt might hamper the productivity have now been proven wrong. The Chromebook still boots up in seconds and no issues of lag noticed. Android apps and PWAs from the Playstore make everyday use simple.Original Review - My first Chromebook purchase. I wasn't sure how the shift from windows is going to be. But Chrome OS is great - quick, smooth, safe and very light on processor and battery.So the HP Chromebook 14a looks very premium in the silver color and its extremely light to carry around. The battery lasts for around 12 hours which seems unbelievable but it's true.I have used it for the office work with Google docs and the video conference calls and also for streaming movies. Does everything quite easily.It's been more than 2 months of using this and I can easily recommend HP CHROMEBOOK 14A for anyone looking to buy a laptop in the 25-30k price bracket. I got it under 25k during a deal and I feel it's absolutely BANG FOR THE BUCK!!"
1,The product is of very cheap quality and it does not support the commonly used Zoom app which is very much required in today‚Äôs Pandey situation.Poor
1,"Chromebook is not a matured product yet. Many apps which work on Android devices don't get installed on Chromebook or don't work similar to Android devices. This gap should be fixed by Google Play Store otherwise it's waste of investment on Chromebook ideology. Also keyboard missing delete button. I'm now using it for few months and there are already lot of bugs in Chrome OS like it keeps auto right clicking all the time rendering the laptop unuseful, rebooting multiple times helps pause this issue for some time. Product seems not properly tested before releasing."
1,Display is not working during whatsapp video call.Display is blur and fedded during video calling.
1,Laptop is good with touch screen. But it is chrome os and can't install windows os so I wasted money buying this. They are not taking returning this product also üòîüòî
2,"Pros-1.Fast and light2.Touchscreen is good3.Battery lasts long(10+ hours)and charging from 0 to 100 takes only a hour and few mins.4.Sound quality is good. Cons-1. Less storage2. Camera quality is extremely bad.3. Not all apps from play store is supported.4. Texts and display quality is poor and it's glitch a bit except from chrome browser. (Not suitable for reading :( )5. No backlit keyboard6. Chrome browser runs automatically when start.6. Screen brightness is always default (need to change it lower everytime when start) üò¨üò™7. Chrome browser setting like (on start up, continue where you left off)is not available. Need to minimize chrome browser again and again. :(8. Display turn off automatically after 15 mins and it can't be changed.:("
1,"Bought this in March 2021. Stopped working in a few days.Engineer came and fixed, suggesting issue with battery.In mid July laptop stopped working again. Engineer visited and replaced the motherboard.Then asked to call HP for installing operating system! HP call center after hours of wasting my time asked me to visit service center.Nobody picks calls at the service center. Mumbai has only one, that too at Sakinaka.Service center guy says you need to bring a 32 GB bootable hardisk with software preloaded from HP website."
3,"The Legendary chrome book,  that performs like a 2gb ram, (it's 4gb ram model ), I had to return the first one and since there's no option for refund,  had it replaced by another one,  thanks anyways,  second one same model is working fine but not the 4gb models performance,  updated it to latest version of chrome,  using it as daily driver,  since it's upgrade of my 2gb Acer chrome book which is still doing good,  this one's not up to the mark,  sorry Hp, I wasted 25k on this honestly,  buyers looking for Hp chrome book, Avoid all together!!"
5,I am writing this review after using 1week.Nice product my daughter loved it and very easy to use for kidsAdvantages1 slim and thin2 less wait and easy to carry3 os is fast4 download all android apps which supports to chrome os5 Battery backup superDisadvantagesLess storageCannot add widgetsLess usb ports
5,"Its a mind blowing purchase , At the very little cost you are getting a great quality product performance is mind blowing looks are mind blowing and if we compare it with the MacBook air it is giving a tough competition to it and chrome OS is mind blowing no lags know and complexity it is very easy to use and you have to think beyond Windows because windows constantly having problem like viruses lags crashing and all less battery back up but it has a battery backup of 12 hours, Believe in my words you would never regret if you have basic expectation With a mobile phone or laptop this is a wonderful device I recommend all an Amazon is wonderful and very helpful"
5,"Okay, as a tech enthusiast, I've been looking for a Chromebook for a while and after doing some research, I narrowed down to this.Firstly, the delivery was the same day, which I didn't want to believe to be fair, but it happenedA few things to keep in mind before you buy a Chromebook in general, is that they are not your windows or Mac devices. Although the functionality of the devices will be limited, these are still quite capable devices.Coming to this particular device, What I love about this:The keyboard is surprisingly better than i was expecting at this price pointIt is a touch screen which I might not use, but will come in handy for most peoplethe trackpad is decentbattery life is greatThere is a bit of a learning curve but you will enjoy the deviceConsThe screen isn't full HDBuild quality is plastic, good plastic, but plastic nonethelessOverall, this Chromebook can be a daily use laptop for many people who are looking for Web Browsing, WFH and Basic task.Please don't expect this Chromebook to run premiere pro or photoshop. And please don't look at things it can't do look at things that it can."
4,"overall the product is good ..thickness is very good......light weight ...and touch screen good....pubg gaming and cod gaming is not that good unless u add some graphic card or etc......the only problem is the display , but for this price range it is the best laptop for a collage students .........basic gaming is very good no lags ....and another problem is miscroft apps are paid apps , u need to buy them to use them......portable laptop......"
5,"I have been using it for 4 months, its my secondary device.pros:1.Good battery life2.Touch is good, better not to use because it is not convertible3.Good keyboard4.HD+ good screen5.simple OS6.Boots in 5 seconds7.Good speakers8.Charges in 1 hour9.Brightness is good10.Updates are frequent.Cons:1.White balance of screen is different in different angles2.No backlit keyboard3.Camera is average4.the processor can handle simple games(like alto's odyssey) from playstore or simultaneously run 6 apps or 25 tabs in chrome over that you will face lag5.laptop is bit heavier."
5,"Does the job. You can consider this entry level laptop for basic needs, online study, communication, attend meetings, simple school, college projects, watching movies in average quality screen, read books etcYou get what you paid for and don't complain after you start using it. But having said that, it does exactly what it's meant and priced for. Used for 9 months. Doesn't take time to learn if you are an Android phone user already.And it's used by someone with zero knowledge on Macs or Windows. So you can imagine how easy it is to use.Buy of you are looking for entry level laptop. Touchscreen for senior citizens, or those who are not computer savvy. Makes their life a lot easier and they won't complain. It makes them proud to be on their own and being a Laptop or we can say Lablet. ;)"
4,"These are my first impressions about the productThe Pros is it is lightweight, has a nice touchscreen and a keyboard, so it serves as a laptop and also like a tab, which is very convenient. I found most of the features are helpful and the time it takes to start is very less, compared to the MS os. Charging is good and stays on for much of the time.Con is about the keyboard key placement, no End key or Del key which is very critical for working on Docs and Excel files. for every delete operation, we got to go to the end and press backspace ,which is irritating, also the power key is above the backspace key, and accidentally one can press the power key, which will turn off the laptop.overall it is a decent product for the price range it offers."
4,"After reading all the reviews, thought of giving it a try and I had mixed feelings. Here are my observations.1. Super Fast. Apps get installed at a sheer pace. Uninstalling hardly takes 2 seconds.2. Touch Screen is very good and responsive.3. HD Ready Screen, not so good. However, at this price, you can't get better. Not sure of ASUS counterpart though.4. Audio Output is average from both earphones and the speakers. Could have been a lot better. At max volume, it's very bad. Gives a rattling type output.5. Camera is just fine. Does the job for normal video calls on Skype & Zoom.6. Microsoft Excel/ Word/ PPT need 365 subscription. However you can edit or work on the above using Google Sheets/Docs/Slides.7. You can set wallpaper on homescreen (From any source, Your files too) as well as Lockscreen (Only from Google Photos)Overall, ""Can Try"" device for this price point."
5,"1. Good performance and battery life is also good (above 12hrs). Charging time 1.5 to 2 hr.2. In description they mentioned Fingerprint scan lock but I can't find it.3. Storage is very low, and you won't get exact space mentioned in description.4. Easy to use, feels like using android with big screen.- It have 1USB port,1 memory card slot, 2 charging ports, headset Jack port.-You can use Microsoft apps with internet ofcourse you will need internet for every app which requires internet.- don't worry it works well without internet also. (For apps which don't need internet)I recommend this to1. All students (except programmers and those who do simulations etc type of work)2. Those who want entertainment.3. To do basic office work and browsing.4. Those people preparing for competitive exams.-Not for programmers, heavy users.-About gaming I don't know(I never played any)-Not a substitute for PC if you are software engineer or alike employee.If you want to take chromebook, I will suggest take one with touch screen feature ."
4,"Chromebook does not allow you to sideload apps from storage.Apps can be installed from official app store only. (workarounds ie development mode is painful)So if you are considering it for use with Byju's app or similar, Pl don't.MS office doesn't work either, so you need to use WPS office or similar.However, that said, as long as you are okay with aforementioned restrictions, this is a wonderful notebook with great battery backup."
4,"Guys it's a Chromebook based on a ultra light OS and is a perfect machine for basic tasks like Web browsing, online meets, basic file editing and Android app support. The moment you open it it heads out to the homescreen and is ready for tasks. Those who are familiar with Linux can benefit from it as it's a whole new world with various Linux Os's installed. It's also noteworthy that Chrome Updates are almost weekly and new additions are made along with the best of security."
5,"The product is excellent for office use. 7 hours battery life with light music in the background while working on docs. The battery life is a huge win.Keyboard is excellent! I do a lot of drafting and found the keyboard accurate and comfortable. The touchscreen is a huge plus, I've stopped carrying/using a mouse with me.You can install linux based apps on the chromebook as well. Thereby, the overall value for money is just top notch."
5,"Sleek and light. Works better than any other Windows laptop in this price segment since Chrome OS is very much optimised. Browsing, surfing and streaming are fun on the go. Definitely, this one is not an option for seekers of intense computing but would be best for your daily work such as attending meetings and online classes (got a great camera quality). It supports most of the Android apps making it easy to get through things. The Intel Celeron N4020 & 4 gigs of RAM does it all. As far as memory is concerned. 64 GBs of SSD space is provided as well as 100 GBs of cloud storage for all which I find a little less. However, it's expandable to 256 GBs through micro SD cards.Overall, it's a great deal!"
1,"No. Don't waste money by taking this labtop, unless it will allow Windows operating system to install. It's just large version of mobile with bigger screen. There is no difference between this labtop & mobile. Unfortunately, I have wasted money by taking this labtop. Even company not provide microsoft office for free."
5,"I chose this for two main reasons: 1) smooth web-experience - like email, railway/flight search ticket booking, hotel booking, social media , Google drive and photos and 2) good battery backup, so that I don't need to bother about staying closer to a plug point.In both the points, the product has far-exceeded my expectation.Let me add few more:3) I could install Linux and seamlessly used miniconda for python programming.4) With only 64 GB storage ( that too reduced further after operating system load), I was sceptical. But so far, I have not faced any challenges. Linux installation took 10 GB of which miniconda took 4 GB with all python essential libraries and small codes what I need. Still my Linux has 6GB empty space. The Chromebook has more than 35 GB space. I generally prefer keeping my important files in two 3 hard disks simultaneously (as back up) . So 35 GB is enough.5) Similarly with celeron processor, I was also sceptical. Now I know, I can relax. There is no perceivable difference for running small codes with a standard computer. For complex with many grid search cross validation kind of programs, I'd rather use Google Colab.6) The laptop is really light !7) Volume and sound quality is good8) Track pad is very responsive ( I did one time setting change to activate the ""natural scrolling"" and select-and-drag).9) keyboard looks little different , not yet explored the function keys ( there seems to have some options, however I like the keys whatever is there in place of function keys). I just live with the occasional 'rename'  requirement without F2 key :) by right-click. Caps lock is a bit strange combination, but not too disadvantageous once you find it from internet.10) Oh yes, Microsoft office applications may be a problem (not sure though, 365 version may just work as well) - I have not tried that, honestly. I use Google Doc and Sheet for common use with perfect ease."
5,Chromebook is better than windows my children loved it but they should give laptop bag also overall very nice
5,This laptop is a perfect chromebook.1. Its battery life is amazing2. Cheap affordable touch screen laptop3. Can easily replace your windows laptop4. Runs almost same like your android phone5. More user-friendly than a windows laptop
3,"Only for browsing and watching movies, best for student online classes, not at all used for office work. Just like a android tab with keyboard. Windows OS users please make sure to double check before buying there is no return policy, I bought it for office use and now using for kids online classes üòî"
4,This Chromebook is sturdy with good battery life for normal usage. There was little finishing issues at back panel but it is something not noticeable. I have used it mostly for browsing and faced no issues as such with performance. Touch scree is good by considering the price of this product but it is not comparable with high end devices.
4,"From outside it's completely new, they replaced body with new one(local made).Touch response is bit delayed, key are ok,Battery 2+ hours.Finger senser, hmm ü§î I used but it recognized after so many times,Better to go with chromebook, for study purpose.One thing which amazed me its proccesing speedYou can even code"
3,For plain office use
1,"Incredibly bad display . Not HD as described. Do not fall into the trap of buying this laptop. There are many other laptop with FHD , less than this price. This same laptop with 10th Gen i3 processor is FHD but newer variant with 11th gen processor  does not have HD ."
5,Best ever laptop under 50000
3,"Laptop is good for moderate users.Has Samsung brand SSD, speakers are too good, makes less noise.Only con is display, the display is 720p.You can definitely find a FHD display in this range."
5,"Better multi-core performance (i3, 11th gen, 1125G4) with 4 cores and 8 threads as compared to i3 11th gen 1115g4 (2cores, 4 threads)."
5,"Superb laptop at the perfect price, I am writing this review after 2 weeks of use, Actually, I bought this for my son's online classes and also thought of using it occasionally for my office work as well. It's actually a very good laptop for day-to-day usage, It has an i3 11th gen processor and 8 GB Ram with 256 GB SSD Ram a power pack machine.It turns on when you open the lid and up for work just within 10 seconds thanks to the SSD Hard disk. I never find any lagging till now even doing multitasking due to better ram.About Screen quality, so it has a good sharp, crisp, and clear screen however missing the IPS hence need to adjust the screen as per your sitting position.The keyboard is very smooth and the number pad is separate which is actually good for work on excel and calculations. Also has dedicated multimedia keys. Backlight can be a plus point however if you are not working too much at the night then really doesn't matter.About the battery backup so it works almost like 5 hours on battery and this laptop having a rapid charge function which charges the battery much faster. Thanks to Lenovo Vantage software which is giving multiple nice features.Camera Quality: I have searched many laptops but only a few having good quality cameras, this laptop is one of them, It has a good 720P high-resolution camera useful for Office meetings, online classes and showing good impression.it also has preinstalled Alexa which is useful for timepass in between.. Kids actually enjoy this.I think have covered almost everything, there is still a few more good about it like 2 yrs warranty, a lifetime licence for windows 10 and MS-office for free and lifetime.I am not a gamer so no idea about gaming and I guess for gamers and software developers i5 and i7 can be better options.Overall this is the best Laptop for day to day work..I hope this reveiw will be helpful for others... Thank you !!"

1,"Guys, don‚Äôt buy laptops and such gadgets from Amazon, you will be let down by their partners. I waited for 3 days for the delivery, I had purchased the new laptop on an exchange. The delivery person started pointing out all insignificant issues with the old laptop, which was in a perfect working condition, and cancelled the order in abruptly, they mentioned the reason that the old laptop doesn‚Äôt meet the exchange criteria, whereas no such thing was mentioned on Amazon. This left a very bad taste of customer experience."
1,Received no display Laptop. Return process is also not up to mark. Delivery agent deny to to pick up so many time because screen is not working even if I have mention screen issue clearly.
1,Same model available with higher configuration i7 processor with lower cost. I3 this model not available in lenevo website. So don't waste your money on i3 old generation Laptop.

4,Very versatile and functional machine.  And for the price of 22k it is a must have machine fir light day to day work. Very good build quality.
1,Can't detect the hard disc and can't upload operating system windows10.Replace with new one.
5,"Unexpectedly beast power, better hinge quality, better design and better build quality. I searched for 5600h laptops but on  great indian festival saw it for 1st time and decided to go for it. since dell has best service I have seen in last 10-12 or laptops at home.Its like perfect device. you can also customize screen color profile and saturation for display warmer or cooler side colors.you get lot of air vents on top , left, right and back. bottom you get air intake vents.haven't yet tested for gaming will check soon.. rest it maintains temp cool since Ryzen 5600h is 7nm technology.Note :- There's one thing which you have to change otherwise you start thinking it's faulty display - under amd radeon settings turn off that vari-bright option. It increases gamma of display and reduces brightness to save some battery but screen colors look ugly."
3,Only issue I am facing is that fan only runs when you turn on G mode ....before that if you play without G mode laptop will heat but once you turn on G mode this is by far the best thermally stable gaming laptop
5,I liked the product build and quality.The hardware is a top notch once and no heating issues at all. Outside people give all nonsense review about heating and fan noise. This is a very recommended product if you are doing a very intense work on the laptop which requires less than 16GB ram. Really this is awesome for anyone with extra work and fast results like rendering core applications and other important documents videos and games as well.
1,Welcome screen on Cortana stuck. I had to take it to the dell service center
4,It is a fairly nice laptop. Got it for 75k 16gb ram variant. For that price a good deal. Graphic card is good screen is fine. Sound is a bit low. Battery is fine. No heating with gameshift turned on. Fifa 22 worked good nd fine even without charger connected. Yet to try more applications.
1,Delivered dead laptop which was also certified by Dell technician. Please replace it with the same laptop.
4,"AMD series 6 coming yet prices are the same, i wonder why prices is not coming down. The new processor appears to be efficient than the one shown with this laptop"
5,Good cooling and good battery life good performance it boots up very fast good display and the best charger charges quicker than my phone
5,"Good machine for gaming. Battery life not so good only 1 hr. However gamers keep the laptop on power always for better performance so it's not an issue. Charger comes with a power cord which is difficult to use with standard socket. Have placed order for power extention board for using it. Only con is just 512 gb ssd, need atleast 1 tb. Don't know whether we can replace it.After using it I found battery can last about 3-4 hrs depending on usage."
5,"Interestingly I did not buy it for gaming purpose at all. but for purely academic, where extensive drafting work plus online lecture was required.The size of laptop is hardly little more than the std 15.6inches screen laptop so no issue with the bulkiness but better screen area utilisation. Multiple window work is easily doable.Screen is glare free and easy on eyes,Battery life not an issue as you can adjust the refresh rate and brightness etc and enhance.The deal was superb and unmissable on account of exchange offer.Overall good deal and it served well my purpose."
5,I am not a gamer and it's my first time using a gaming laptop. Before I was on to an low performance one with just 4 gb ram and so... Back then i was dreaming of playing GTA 5 and froza horizon and i had fulfilled it through YouTube. But now I can play what ever shit I want and gives me a different feel of gaming. I regret I was too late on to msi gf series and surely will buy one for my best friend.. Thanks msi for providing this budget friendly gaming beast and supporting new gamers like me.. Iam loving it
5,"I got this laptop under 61k and I love this laptop, it's just amazing, solid bulid quality, looks simply sexy, very smooth as well as fast and it's 144hz screen was cherry on cake but it feels quite heavy otherwise it's an amazing laptop. If ur budget is approx 60k then close ur eyes and buy this without any doubt. Now windows 11 Updatedüòâ"
5,"Powerful, Compact and Robust.Overall ‚Äì BUY500gb SSD becomes way more less when you start playing games that have huge sizes, such as GTA 5, COD 2019.

5,"I was seeking a 17.3 inch laptop for everyday use. I am not a gamer or rather say I hate games. There are various brands providing 17.3 inch variants. But I chose MSI after reading the reviews here. And also saw the images which indicates that the power button of this laptop is not with keyboard. Power button in keyboard is horrible. I rejected other brands' variants only for that.Now come to this one. A beautiful display with 144mhz refresh rate. I don't know what to do with that, but it's beautiful. Really beautiful üòçWith 8gb RAM and 500GB nvme SSD and i5(10th gen) quad core processor, the boot time is fast but not as fast as my previous one which I exchanged with it in a reasonable price. Also, that doesn't bother me. Difference for few seconds is ignorable.Windows 11 installed instantly. I don't like Windows 11 , but there's nothing I can do about it.Norton antivirus is installed for 60 days trial. I never used antivirus before. I always depended on windows defender before. But I like this one. I am thinking that I would renew Norton after the trial period.The MSI dragon center is an excellent environment. You have to turn your webcam off/on from there. There are other options in it too. Webcam is decent enough.Now come to battery- It frighteningly drains fast if you play games in extreme performance mode. My 10 years old son once played Asphalt9. The gaming experience to him was excellent but 20 minutes of playing consumes 50% of battery. Although there are ways to save battery charge.Keyboard is fine. Touchpad is little shaky. I don't konw if it's a good or bad things for gamers. Build quality is good enough for me.Overall, it's a good laptop in around 60k. The seller Apario retail is also good and trustworthy.  My suggestion, if your budget permits then go for it. Do not buy 15.6 inch laptop. 17.3 inch will give you vast space which is very comfortable for multitasking."
5,"I am using it for 8+ hours daily for development work, the performance is awesome, planned to upgrade the RAM to 16 GB, no heating issues, plastic body is not so great quality, but display quality and audio quality are too good. good product for gamers and developers.  overall simply loved it. i bought it for 57k."
5,"Gaming - 8/10Battery - 2/10Display - 8/10CPU runs hotter than the GPU. MSI dragon center must be installed for cooler boost function unless you wanna cook something on it !!. USB ports are unusually tight. Display is just amazing as the bezels are significantly thinner which makes the laptop not much oversized than the 15.6 inch laptops. Battery is an absolute trash. I've noticed some backlight bleeding at the bottom right corner of the screen. Overall build quality is good, strong and sturdy.  For 58K, this baby is an absolute win"

5,"Very satisfied purchase from amazon. Amazing performed. Good to play games, no lagging, no streaming."
1,WORST QUALITY
5,Super laptop. Everything is good except battery life. Usually in gaming laptops we can't expect more battery life. This is 17'3 inch laptop. So obviously it consumes more battery when you heavily use it. Overall This laptop is 100/100 in this budget.

5,Best laptop I heard this time in this price range. My friend has same laptop and i experienced this laptop by playing games like valorant and seriously i never played a game in a laptop like this. I loved it
5,"- I am using this laptop for about 15 days and if you need a future-proof laptop then this is the one.- The best part is the thermal system of this laptop, literally, this laptop doesn't heat up which definitely extends the life your laptop.- Almost all software available in the market is optimized to give the best performance with Intel processors and here you got the latest 11 generation intel i5 Hexa core processor.- The build quality is best, the design is awesome and the performance is powerful.- The typing experience you will get on this laptop is simply fabulous, better than Legion and Tuf laptop.- You can easily open the laptop lid with a single hand.- I use MATLAB and some CAD Softwares on this laptop which works very smoothly without any issue.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop. It lasts around 3 to 4 hrs for multitasking and heavy work.- Recently, I have upgraded my laptop to windows 11 which is working fine.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop."
1,I got a faulty product the charger wasn‚Äôt working and i ordered the 1tb 256ssd variant but i got 512ssd variant delivered which was faulty even thou on my invoice it mentioned the 1tb variant.
5,one of the best thermals out there intels new Alder Lake CPU with Nvidia RTX 3050 for smooth gamingpersonally using it and liked it so muchJust add another ssd for even better performance
5,Best gaming laptop in this range even after long hours of gaming it does not get much heated like the other laptops.  The display is amazing for gaming. Does not get heated fast can play for 3 to 4 hours without it getting heated.  Comfortable keyboard for gaming. The battery life is excellent for gaming laptop. I thought my charger was not working so I got in touch with the customer care and they were super helpful resolved my issue immediately actually the charger had to be pushed all the way it is a double push when it connects we hear a click sound.
5,"Loved this Laptop, Simply Amazing, Go for it"
5,"BATTERY IS A BIT LOW COMPARED TO OTHERS OF SAME PRICE BUT HDD AND SSD COMBO MAKES UP FOR THE LOSS, THERMALS ARE AWESOME.SERIOUSLY GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT BEST RTX 3050 LAPTOP, EVEN THOUGH THE TGP OF THE GPU IS A BIT LOWER THAN THE ROG STRIX G15, THE PERFORMANCE IS TOO BIG. HENCE GO FOR IT."
5,"Worth the money, if anybodys laptop is unable to charge up, remember to push the pin inside the charger port all the way in."

5,Good laptop at this range. Laptop speed is fentastic. And looking good with rgb keyboard and the buttons of keyboard are also good.
4,"Go for it, it's a nice pick."
3,"I am writing this review after about 1 month of usage. The specs can be looked at in the description. So, I will tell about the problems only. The keyboard spacing is not good. You will need time to get used to it. I am a programmer by profession. So, even though I know the key placements, typing errors are frequent. Touchpad's build quality doesn't look good. Also one needs to pick up the laptop with both hands, otherwise, some issues arise (like fan making noise). This laptop attracts dust, so need some measures for that also (keyboard cover). The battery is average (wouldn't have expected much as it is a performance-oriented laptop and 60Hz minimises the battery consumption). Many times, only 2 USB ports can be used (has 3 ports, but 2 are very close). The power point at the back also creates an issue (one needs to be extra cautious while charging). Sometimes, it gets heated even while using a browser and a media player and file explorer opened. So, it is an average product."
5,"Push charging pin through it will work , everything is fine in laptop nice  deal  good laptop üëç üëç üëç"
5,"1. First at all to every one i want to say do not think about bad reviews for this laptop because those bad reviews is not for its laptop those are 11300H which is 4 core 8 thread.And other for who got defective product (it is main reason for bad reviews) .2. Before buying this laptop i had done lots of research, wathing lots of video and the end i am confused with two processor amd (ryzen 5 5600H 6C 12T) and intel (i5-11400H 6C 12T in this laptop)CONCLUSION (this new intel processor beats  ryzen processor ) so that's why i choose this one.  ***************** Now about this laptop **************1. Everything awesome just go for it blindly.2. Performance 5/5. (base clock 2.7 and upto 4.5 ) ( 6 Core 12 Thread thanks god) ( Chace memory L1 480 KB, L2 7.5 MB, L3 12 MB always remember L1 chace is most speed ,powerful and costly)3. Display 5/5. (144 Hz)4. Build quality 5/5.5. Thunderbolt 4 and its wifi speed is fantastic (advantage..)6 Battery 5/4. (because it is gaming laptop always play game while charging it will give more performance and save your battery life.)7. Speaker 5/4. (yaa speakers is little bit low, but  you can  increase speakers volume by its dts software.)8. it's actual weight is 2.3 Kg not 2.4 i saw on acer offical site."
1,"I am highly disappointed with the product, the first time I got a faulty product it did not even start, after replacement the second one which was suppose to be 1 TB HDD but was only 500 GB.misleading information on the Amazon page.Waiting for my refund and return. I do not TRUST them anymore."
5,"Bought Ryzen 5 version of this from a HP store near Thoraipakkam in Chennai  two months back (Ryzen 7 wasn't available anywhere then).Solid performer, Great screen 400+nits 16:10, incredibly silent, good thermals.Slight drawback is avg keyboard & mediocre palm rejection on trackpad. KBD has slight wobble and different pressure on lower left (Ctrl & Shift) keys."
5,"It's really fast and it is the lightest laptop in the market, enjoying it a lot. AMD Ryzen 7 5800u processor is blazing fast. It is Cheaper to buy from Hp store."
1,"Specifications is different of the product, it mentions that storage is one terabyte,but where as its220 gb, and 4 Gb Ram it is,where it should be 8 gb,absolute waste of time and money"
1,We bought this laptop considering the fact that it has i3 Processor and 8GB inbuilt RAM thus making the system faster. But in reality this is worst laptop I ever used in past 20 years. This laptop hangs randomly and takes a lot of time (some times more than 2 mins) to respond. Sometimes it does not respond and needs to be forcibly rebooted. With time its becoming worse. Do not buy this.
1,"Please don't buy this laptop in initial days it works fine but after 5 to 10 days later , it won't work properly even it starts hanging.Hence would humbly request everyone whoever is planning to purchase this laptop please don't buy as brother I can say this ...Please don't buy .."
4,Specifications are same as mentioned in website. You will love it's slim and compact design. Model number Vostro 3000 not 3400.Intial booting was slow after driver updation and setup now it s normal.Windows 10 & Ms-Office inbuilt.You need to uninstall additional McAfee antivirus. Many people are complaining about slow booting. McAfee is not require. Windows 10 is having by default virus protection.Let's see how will it run further. this is my first review after opening the packet.
1,"Dont Buy this product at all. Worst product.Hanging issues, heating issues from day of purchase. Cant even use a single web browser properly."
1,"Very worst performance eventhough the configuration is good .  Please don't buy this... Just delivered today and started using without even anyother software installed... But it takes time to open the browser and if we type 5 letters and wait, then it appears.  Very worst performance... I am returing today itself .."
1,"Dell Vostro 3401 14 inch (35.5 cm) FHD Display Laptop (11th Gen i3-1115G4 / 8GB / 1TB HDD / Inte  Windows system process is very slow ,please its change . And reply immediately to Mr Rajaram subudhi mail id:"
1,"I received it yesterday and even to boot up it takes more than 15mins it's total waste of money. When I checked I got broken piece. I raised complaint and they replaced it only.  Now after using 1 month will come to know actual quality of this dell laptop. if you wish to buy laptop or other electronic item buy from authorized store ""Don't Buy from online"" it's trap."
1,this is the slowest laptop i ever used. Right from the windows boot up.I cant believe i3 11 gen processor is slower than my i3 3rd gen.Even opening the browser is taking time.Have reset the windows twice and the same issue is there. Dont know what to do this useless machine.
5,"Contrary to reviews about slow startup and all, i found this laptop quick and responsive. I have an 8gb version and even without SSD it is responding well. The key is to apply available windows updates and allow McAfee version provided to speed up your machine."
5,"Before I purchase i read all reviews but I purchased same laptop.  For this budget the performance and look is good. Rs.37500 only, today its delivered. keyboard back light is not available, size little big but Weightless."
2,We got this laptop in fourth week of Aug 2021 and not charging since last month. We made the complaint and tecnician visited after 10 days and told that a part needs to be replaced. It will again take time deliver the part and he will visit once part is arrived. It is bad experience with issues on laptop within months and slow process of rectification
1,"It's a piece of plastic trash made by Dell. Not worth at all. Lags on booting due to HDD and insufficient RAM. This machine needs Nvme SSD + 16 GB RAM for smooth run. Built quality also not upto mark, see Dell's previous models of Latitude Series having super build quality."
1,Never buy laptops by online please üôè. Just it's been one month after i purchased this laptop.now suddenly display lost it's complete brightness without any physical damage to it. And it's difficult to find dell service center near by for claiming its warranty as it's seems to be repaired by service center for its hardware damage.
5,Product found defective after verifying the Amazon Technical Support Team but also thankfull Amazon Technical Support Team to arrange a replacement of this product
5,Reasonably fast and affordable. Works well for all the usual requirements. Good for programming and running mid level heavy software. Quality is top notch from Dell
1,"Touch mouse is not working, system getting restart automatically technician visit getting reschedule duplicate product...  better to buy from respective store rather Amazon..."
2,"The dell vostro I bought is very laggy,  very slow in responding, screen time to initiate is also very long , most of the time gets hanged, need to wait for long hours, worst product I bought. Loss of money ..."
1,Very slow to boot... Occasionally having problem with audio jack for headphones.... Not feeling satisfied with the money paid
3,I got 8GB RAM & 1TB HDD machine but its very slow. Better to go SSD version.
3,"Nice product (look, feel and weight) but even 8 Gb version is very slow. Also, it's a bit tedious to get office activated."
1,Laptop is very slow. Booting up and making application starts will take more than 10 minutes.Not recommended at all.
1,Had to spend 6k on SSD to make it work.Lost the Office setup due to new SSD install.In Ubuntu audio drivers have issues.Cannot connect wide screen external monitor. Motherboard does not support.
1,"Sound quality is too bad, Flipkart is much better than Amazon in Reviwing customer service. But every they the repeat the same answer ""it's not possible"". After buying this laptop I felt that they have looted my money. Instead of using this laptop it's ok to break and spit on Amazon üí¶"
1,I purchased same product but it's real spec was 4gb and 220 gb.. Worst experience
5,Before buying that product I had checked the review for the same on Amazon. Most of the buyers was complaining about the slow working and hang issue. In my opinion the product is excellent and there is no issue regarding the slow working and lagging.
5,Good budget laptop. Not too much slow as mention in review .it is HDD and not compare it to SSD laptop. Good processing and configuration with Dell platform.
5,Great speed for purchasing üëåüëåüëåHighly recommended
1,It's quality is very poor. I found trouble in operating it. It's curser not seeing most of the time & I have to shutdown it by power button. I don't suggest it to anyone
4,Seller did not share the MS office key which was included with the purchase
4,Nice packaging by Amazon. product is nicely working.when I received the package and open the laptop is not working but I plugged the charger in. then laptop become switch on.
4,More than meets the expectations. Value for money.
5,"Item is fine, if you are looking any compact size laptop then its a best thing for you. You may add 8gb ram which will improve experience and make it a smooth."
5,Computer is good but not able to activate Office
1,Worst persomance I ever seen. Very bed quality. Last month I purchased bt now hanging up device. So not too buy in this I too much costly under this feature
5,"This is such a premium looking laptop at this price point. Extremely light weight, classy looking body and keyboard, ssd boot, pre-installed windows 10, fingerprint recognition along with new features from the updated os. Everything is beautiful in both form and function. I am very satisfied with it, the packaging and even the small and compact power cable. Can't believe something so good can be available at this price point. The boot time is significantly fast than other laptops, comparable with macbook. I am techy and very nitpicky about gadget features and specifications at a given price. So this laptop is awesome in every sense!I just received it today. Will update this post if i see in any issues in the coming months."
4,"Thin and light but delicate too. Bought it for 23K, so bit pricy. As Win10 has Windows Defender, no need for redundant Antivirus program. So uninstalled McAFee as it slows down entry level systems. Uninstalled Microsoft Office 365 trial copy and installed MS Office 2010. The system is working fine and smooth for daily works like Web browsing, MS Office etc.P.S  It seems this model with Celeron 4020 is putup for sale since May '21, and hence old reviews here are for earlier model GQ329 with Celeron 3350 processor.  The discontinued model was sold at around ‚Çπ 18 to 20K it seems."
5,"I am using this laptop for a week and feeling so much thankful to my choice of purchase as it is working accordingly my expectations .This laptop was manufactured in Apr 21 and have great features like fingerprints 256GB ssd which gives flawless speed and having fast charging capacity although it is not full HD but still not much difference in picture quality comparatively.The most favored thing in this laptop is that is of only 21350 INR by HDFC credit EMI transaction .As I bought it for study purpose, it is one of the best laptop in this price range."
1,"The MRP shown was around Rs. 45,000/-, as per Prime day offer the price will be around Rs. 34000/-. To avail this offer, I took the prime membership Rs. 129/-. After exchange, the price was Rs. Rs. 24,990/-. All seemed well till now. After receiving the laptop the price on the packet was Rs. 30,000/-So the whole Prime day sale, Prime Membership was all a big BS. The exchange is yet to take place.The product is good, but the Prime day sale, big discounts etc was making fool of the customers, nothing more."
1,"Dear Sir,Recently i had buyed Asus Vivobook and week after delivery i'm facing so many problems and i had complained on 6/8/21 but your service engineer's did'nt arrived yett so tell me what can i do should i throw the product in dustbin and now i don't want any service from you and as well as amazon your service and amazon service is WORST WORST WROST and and now onwords i recommend to othewr people that don't buy any product from Amazon i want replacement or give my money back"
5,"Nice laptop. Writing this review after 1 week full usage.Pros:SSD laptop, so high speed performance.Booting time less than 15 seconds.Anti glare screen. So no eye strain after long online classes, particularly good for kids.Multi tasking working fine.No lagging found while surfing, attending online classes, working with acrobat, word, excel, powerpoint...Battery backup excellent, almost 6 hours nonstop usage....Cons:Camera quality average, but ok for online classes and meeting.Have to buy external hdd, since it has only 195 gb available space...Due to processor, high end gaming not possible.Verdict.Bought at 21k. If your budget around 20 to 25k and looking for online classes or for normal office works or office works, then definitely go for it.."
4,I Got this laptop in 23k and others are get this in 18 or 20k laptop this is not fare üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò£üò£üò£but laptop is Good
5,"It is a perfect value for money Laptop from ASUS. it is just for daily users not for gamer or edition person. I have purchased this for office work and my daughter online classes.It is really working fine. Batter life around 4-5 hrs off moderate use. Sound is good. Weight is balanced. It comes with Finger print sensor, which is fats and accurate.Don't worry about basic processor Like Intel celeron. SSD did all. Fast and smooth. U can shutdown and ON your laptop within 10 second. Restart time arround 7 second.Go for it to work moderate on daily basis.ASUS made it possible with the attractive purchase range."
5,I was in doubt that is it will be support Tally & Busy Accounting Softwares.But after buy it all things are going good.Both Softwares are working without any issues.Nice Product üëçüëç
5,"Best configuration at this Price ‚Çπ23k.Does the job, and does it well. Bought it for my daughter's online schooling. No issues so far.Superfast booting and shut down speed. Extra wide screen, well placed key board, biggest mousepad, separate number pad on right side, fingerprint sensor.  What more you want! Integrated Graphics card is giving desired output with speed. All branded components, with no frills.Speakers are giving crystal clear sounds.Looks are good but Silver colour finish is little bit on whiter side. Looks like plastic. Very thin, and I think 'handle with card product.Overall happy with the buy."
1,"Please dont buy.I have used for 1 month.Laptop hangs many times,Now  not starting even though charging is full.Company cheating with customers..."
5,"I'm using this laptop since 4 months. My experience with it has been very satisfying. First of all, would like to say thanks to Amazon for fast delivery and good packaging. Coming to the laptop, it is a good laptop.The screen is good, clarity is nice despite HD only resolution. The speakers sound loud and with audio enhancement inbuilt, the sound is crisp. Ideal for watching movies. It is running Celeron processor which is meant for basic tasks but surprisingly coupled with 256GB SSD, normal tasks such as browsing, reading, document editing with Office feels smooth. But remember it isn't for gaming or heavy tasks. Battery life been great due to power efficient Celeron processor. Earlier I used Core i5 10th gen, although it was powerful but battery life wasn't that great. My usage is light with some browsing, content consumption and editing documents which this laptop serves without breaking a sweat. The fingerprint scanner is nice addition which I find very useful. No need to input pin everytime to unlock. Scanner response is pretty good. Front camera is okay if there's sufficient light in the room as you'd find in this budget. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,"I was looking for a laptop that wasn't too expensive but had enough power to get office work, web browsing etc done. I feel glad I came accross the vivobook. It's quite good for what I had to pay in return and I would suggest anyone wanting to buy this to go for it."
1,Don't buy this product...  I am using this laptop in one day is very poor poor condition Asus  laptop please don't.. and Amazon giving me a damaging product and is giving very very very damaging product so I returned it this product... please don't buy
4,"Features mentioned are incorrect for display  and resolution. It is not FHD it is only HD . Given resolution is incorrect . There are conflicting info given in site.There is no Micro SD card reader available in this laptop.Read only product information section.Just with windows 10 running only with edge browser open cpu is 100 % in use and memory is at 70% use. So 4 gb ram is not enough.It is as good as chrome book . Functionality and its use is very limited .Boot time is very good around 25seconds.Good for browsing , short term video 30min max due to overheating issue.Ms team or zoom is ok but long hours being online may overheat the laptop. VGA webcam , so quality cannot be expected.Ms office apps are working fine , open only one at a time . CPU will run at max always 2.8ghz..no room to expand.Unable to upgrade to windows 11 , keeps telling to download and install but never happens. No error and nothing works. Windows 10 updated and works fine."
5,"My kids Nursery classes started online this academic year and I though to purchase a basic laptop for him, and this one suitably serves the purpose for him. Please note incase applicable; The WebEx virtual background feature will not work on anything below the I3 range of processors, therefore it won't work on this one."
1,After opening the laptop and setting id‚Äôs and all and then restarting it OS crashed and I have to return the laptop.Nothing went well for me so I have to return this laptop
4,"I had an urgent requirement for a regular use laptop for my sister and searched amazon to find this one.Really very good deal under 23k since you are getting 256ssd for this price along with upgradable memory which originally is 4gb out of the box.Overall quality is good with quality speakers and good enough screen even though it is not full HD. But overall specs are also par for the course considering the price and brand of ASUS.But dont expect gaming in this laptop since after all it a celeron processor.I was pleasantly surprised to see a fingerprint sensor which in today's world, laptops costing 3 times more than this dont even provide. So kudos to ASUS for that."
1,"This laptop sucks. No doubt what did I expect after purchasing a ASUS. The laptop does remarkable job to representing the company name, quality and service.  My laptop sporadically stops working for no good reason not even after a month I bought it. Not recommended if you want mental peace. Very dissappointed"
5,"This product is very outstanding if you're looking for a pc for either home,school or college use. Even though product comes with intel celeron processor, it does the job with the help of ssd. Boot up time, battery, picture, fingerprint and sound quality are very good. Awesome design as well. You cannot do gaming. Expanding the ram and ssd would fasten the system. It is light weight and useful for general browsing, home and office works, watching movies etc."
5,"It got the Great looks for sure!!Feels light & easy to carryBattery charges quicklySSD is really fast here!!Display is just okCamera is averageGaming, can run wellVery Decent laptopFor basic operationsto students & teachersBuy it only if you get itfor a good good dealIn any trusted website."
5,Nice laptop higher res compared to others in this price range which is nice. Very quick laptop loads up in a snap and the finger print reader actually works well.Very nice machine for the price - I am a happy customer :)
5,"I really appreciate this kind of lappiReally never expected such a good speed from that 24000 rs. LaptopReallly it is worthyDisplay is also very good in this segmentDont compare this with i3Rather it is much good for browsing, normal working, movies, trading and yesInternet also supports 5gSo need of any lan cable or usb to lan adaptorHi speed wi fi already give us high speed.If yu have low budget definitely go for itOr if you have high budgetBut need a laptop for normal or average purposePlease dont waste yur money in 45000 rs. Laptop or i3 11 generation.Just go for it.I bet you blessed me"
5,Good product for online calss purpose. SSD is very useful. Fast. Coming with Windows 10 OS. Camera is good. Keypads are projected from the base. Easy for kids to operate. Battery back up is perfect. Screen size is bit small. But ok at this cost. Need to install MS Office on our own cost.
5,It's one those for online classes I have checked everything available online. At the end you can only choose this laptop for this budget. Before lockdown it looks like it was much cheaper few bought at 19k I bought this at 22k with offer.
5,It is best laptop. The performance of is best.It have fingerprint scanner also.  Best laptop in this price.
5,"I upgradade to asus from my old dell Laptop, I got a massive discount , and This Asus is value for money as it has a SSD not HDD or hybrid. Which usually last longer, And speed is one of the advantages too."
1,The laptop is not worth. It is very slow in starting. You can't even complete the settings because it keeps on hanging. It starts making weird sounds anytime.
4,"You get what you pay for, I bought it for kids online classes and till now it is working very well for thatDon't expect it to support high end apps"
5,"Very good looking, fast to boot and niceWindows 10 with SSD is a value which nothing in this budget offers.Got for 23k"
1,"Screen is not smart, btw it's good for now"
2,"Looking at the memory card socket in the photo, but when I received the laptop, there is no memory card socket in it."
5,"Have been using it for last 3 months!!As a student its best option. Not for gaming (low end processer). Boots in 10 seconds, no lag at all, wonderful sound quality, good looking and also has a fingerprint sensor.So just go fot it if your budget is around 24k to 25k."
3,The laptop was good but the storage is low as mentioned in Amazon there is 256 SSD but in actual there is only 237 SSD and for use only199 SSD storage so it's very bad thing I realized
1,"If you can, buy it from a local store. My experience have been tremendously bad. One of the speakers isn't working. It's 15 days and here I am calling service centres."
4,"Computer heats up  even at 20¬∞C room temperature  when viewing youtube videos for more than 30 mts. so laptop cooling pad required to minimise heat generation. Also this model lacks the backlit keyboard option. Otherwise good product boots up in seconds, no lagging while launching apps. 4K screen quality with 3D  depth effect, relatively low screen glare. Not suitable for heavy gaming."
1,Microsoft Word documents are Not editable. Very very much disappointed... It says unauthorized MS Office
4,Laptop is lightweight. Seems to be cheap plastic. It is of a good speed now as windows seems to get slower over the period.It makes big noise from processor fan which is surprising.I am yet to review other options.Screen seems to be nice.Keyboard is not backlight and seems to be hard.Soft touch is expected with technological advancement.
5,"The specs are great. SSD, big RAM. Works good overall. 9/10.The viewing angles aren't great though. You would not want more than one person watching a movie on this screen."
1,I have purchased laptop on 6th September 21 and yesterday 1 Nov within two months battery is not working. And Hp care says your battery is not genuine. Now issue is in new laptop parts are not genuine. Who is responsible and how we trust on amzon.
4,At this price range it is a good laptop. After 15 days of use i found-Pros: 1) Boot up and shut down super fast under 5sec.2) Thin and light. Easy to carry.3) Windows 11 out of the box.4) Lifetime MS Office.5) Sound is adequate.Cons:1) Built quality is just so so.2) Battery backup 3-4 hrs of contineous use with wi- fi.3) Display could have been better.4) Somtimes you can here fan noise.
1,Kindly share me product key for home & students MS office for functioning of the same.
1,"Office home & students 2019Microsoft Word documents are Not editable. Very very much disappointed... It says unauthorized MS OfficeTried HP support, I am MCA definitely doing something wrong but NO ONE to helpEven Whts app support keeps saying Ok OK"
5,"Pros :-1) Good processor speed under load.2) Ssd performance is great, no slowdowns during windows update.3) Camera and mic are ok ok.4) Quite high fan speed due to which less heating issues and better stability at higher clocker rate5) There is no bluetooth - wifi coexistence issue at 2.4 ghz.6) Good loudness of the speaker.7) Screen clarity is nice.8) Trackpad also working good.9) No driver issues.Cons:-1) Average battery life.2) Viewing angles are not enough. For, single person, it's good."
5,I received the laptop yesterday. Windows & MS Office are both preinstalled. The registration activation of MS Office was quite easy. Just a high speed Internet connection is required. I also subscribed to McAfee Anti virus as there was an offer bundled with hp laptops and it cost me just ‚Çπ199/- for the first year.Windows too updated to 11 and the working seems to be fast as the laptop has an 8GB RAM & 512 GB SSD which I believe should suffice for my needs.Overall a wonderful experience..Would update in future..
1,Expecting laptop bag along with this laptop.Not received the bag and not happy with this
1,"Whenever I try to connect my wired mouse , the system hanged"
5,I am using the laptop over 2 weeks now and performance is so good. It is definitely a value for money.
5,Works wonderfully with my office team.
1,Lack of ips displayLack of backlid keyboardOther featurs are ok
1,Very Poor laptop after 6 Day of Purchase Display Blackout no resolution.
5,"Value of money ,I bought this before 10 days everything is fine ,Battery backup around 4 hours continue working with multitasking."
4,Good
3,10 days after purchase of this product.. I found that sometimes 2 & 5 button in numeric keypad not working.. unable to resolve..
1,Absolutely disappointing- not able to start even after almost 24 hours despite long hours of charging and many attempts to restart
5,Not used by me has been gifted to my neice
3,It should be i3 11 gen and Very bad camera quality.
3,Good but not up to the mark with respect to battery backup...but overall value for money...
4,Good for professional use.Not a gaming laptop.Fast and no lags
4,Performace is good.
5,"Quick Boot, Light weight, good battery backup."
5,No keyboard lights ....But is good
5,Am using this product from two weeks it‚Äôs nice
3,Screen corner has visible color defect. Keypad has stickers on each button not sure why.
1,"1. Product name is wrong. The product I purchased is a ThinkPad X260. The seller listed it as Latitude X260. The invoice said Latitude X260 as well. But the seller assured me that this was not an issue to avail the 6-month warranty.2. The product is listed with a lower resolution screen. But the screen I got was higher resolution, so I'm not complaining.3. Both batteries are run down. I got 2 hours with both batteries at 100% instead of 6 hours advertised for new models.4. The major disappointment in my case was the keyboard. The Amazon product photo posted clearly shows a US keyboard. The unit I got had a Japanese layout. The Japanese layout has a few extra keys, so some of the regular key sizes and positions are altered. The seller had pasted plain black stickers over some keys to conceal the Japanese lettering underneath. The extra keys are still there, but they don't do anything. The stickers were of poor quality and came off easily. Backspace, Home, End, Delete all are smaller. Enter key has the shape of the number 7. The worst affected was the space bar. The length of the regular spacebar was split between 4 different keys. 3 of these 4 keys are useless. Whenever I typed on the Japanese keyboard, I found myself missing the spaces between words, because my muscle memory is used to working with a longer spacebar. I have several units of Lenovo.5. For those like me, who enjoy typing on Thinkpads, this layout was a joy killer. I wouldn't have purchased this, had I known this keyboard was Japanese. My return window is still open and I haven't still decided if to keep this or return it. Overall this unit was not worth the price even though it was in full working condition as it wouldn't help fulfill my need for a portable machine for typing. Just a case of a careless seller who doesn't even care to write proper specs about the product they are selling."
1,"Duplicate chargers, no operating manual,No windows product key, used products.Warranty only 6 months. Dont buy used products, they are not refurbished, batteryüîã performance is low."
4,"Premium quality product in this price range, look like new, good performance, 5 hrs battery life, recomended, 6months warranty.."
3,After using for 5 days  i cannot able to open the laptop and the charger also not charging. So please help me out to fix
3,Very usefull laptop
1,Never fall trap of deals. Its amazon new scam that they send you faulty product and after that will not retun your money back
4,"I recently made this purchase, which is the first time I made a purchase for such a large amount on Amazon. The laptop was delivered in a good condition. One thing I noticed was that, as some other reviewers mentioned, the warranty was already active about 10 days before I actually received the machine, which I didn't understand. Lenovo and Amazon should clarify this. I had a 15 inch laptop before so this is a little smaller comparatively. It is good for light entertainment, and for office work like preparing documents and presentations. I would not use for it gaming, and in fact I would suggest would be gamers to save their money by assembling a desktop, which is both cheaper and long lasting. For most people working at home, in fact, if you're not going to move around and have no need of travelling for work purposes, a desktop is a far better idea, and most of the time I work on desktop in my office.This laptop is light and fairly fast due to the ssd, although you can swap the drives out for ssds both in the SATA and NVME slots to give you even faster perfomance. There is only one So-DIMM slot, occupied with 8gb gram, with a max of 16gb, so if you want to upgrade to higher and faster RAM modules, you should consider another laptop.The screen is okay and not fabulous like on a macbook or xps, so certainly not recommended for designers and video editors. The keyboard however is quite nice and I love the trackpoint which is fun to use, although I am more accustomed to a trackpad. The trackpad is small and kinda rough, so I don't like it so much, but it gets the job done.In summary, I would recommend this to those who have office or educational work, but are not planning to run heavy gaming or other software like MATLAB, CATIA etc. It is a thinkpad, so definitely long lasting with a great keyboard. I hope this review makes it easier for you to make your decision to buy a new laptop. Finally, Amazon has great support, so I am happy with my decision to buy from them.----‚Äî-‚Äî-------------Update 1Although the hardware is good, Lenovo is terrible at extending warranty or any service related issues. I would say Dell is far better in customer friendliness than Lenovo. I paid for extended warranty but could hardly get any response. Also, there's some backlight bleeding but it's not a major issue until now."
5,"Worth the investment. It's been more than ten months, and the system is working fine.Worth the money. I was in the Apple ecosystem for more than five years. And was using Apple products since 2007. I thought I was competent to use Apple, and it was quite the opposite. Windows and Android shattered my belief about my smartness in regards to choosing tech.I was wondering how people would be so wrong and choose Apple over windows and Android.Yes, Apple looks beautiful but then without brains!It's like your local syllabus pretending to be IB syllabus.It's a welcome change, and this is my 2nd Lenovo in 2 months. And more to come."
1,Received a defective product. Disappointed with shopping for a high prize products in Amazon !! No proper communication for return/refund/replacement of items from either Amazon or Manufacturers
1,"Didn‚Äôt even boot-up.The laptop had some hardware issues, it didn‚Äôt even start. On startup it displayed ‚Äúfan error‚Äù and shut down immediately.Make sure you make a video while unboxing and while starting the laptop for the first time. It will help during interactions with Amazon and Lenovo."
1,Full payment taken in advance and defective product delivered on November 9th. Wait for Technician to come on November 12th for next steps. Such a waste of time.
1,"Brought E14 on 16 November and delivered a faulty product which will not boot . After multiple followups (10 times in 7 days) one person came and checked to confirm the laptop is indeed not working. He also mentioned this laptop has frequent problems. Based on that, I have asked for Refund of my money.. Alas, there is no refund possible from Amazon !!!!Apparantly only replacement with Same faulty series of laptop. Bottom line.. DO NOT BUY SUCH DEVICE FROM AMAZON. Buy it from traditional brick and motor showrooms where you can see touch and get the product you are looking for !"
5,"One thing i was really confused about before buying, is there are two models available20RAS0W500 and 20RAS0JW00 , both having exact similar specification.Only difference I found is W500 has NVME SSD whereas JW00 has SATA SSD. NVME is always better to choose. rest all specs are same.Great looks, feels sturdy and very comfortable keyboard. Charge to 100 % in approx. 75-80 mins. and last for 6/7 hrs minimum with average usage. 14 inch is always better than 15 inch option as it is comparatively lighter to carry and more battery backup than 15 inch.Also the backlit works fine but is not as good as compared to ideapad servies."
1,"Laptop doesn't boot-up at all. It shows Lenovo splash screen and shuts down immediately after showing ""Fan Error"" message. Do record video during unboxing and turning on Laptop, which will be proof of your case and helpful to explain it to Amazon customer service representative.They are replacing the product, hoping that next one will work fine."
5,"I wanted a high performance but budget laptop for my son, who joined B.Tech recently. This purchase was perfect for him. The laptop had very good features and comes are a price at least 30% lesser than normal for such features in other brands! I have been buying laptops for more than 20 years now for my company as an IT Head, so I can recommend this laptop for anybody looking for performance at budget rates."
1,I purchased this laptop a week back and since then i am using on screen keyboard. The reason being few keys are not functioning well especially 'zxcvm' these lower keys. I tried all possible troubleshooting from my end and thinking of a replacement.
4,"It's intel i5-10 gen which is the new version. which was released in July-2020.For productivity, it's the best thing you can put your money on.I am a computer science student this works wonderfully.It contains 8-GB of ram and 128GB of SSD and 1TB of HDD.And thanks to God it comes with a backlit keyboard, I really can't thank enough to god for this feature.The display is pretty decent for the price range they are offering it is indeed a Full-HD.The battery is excellent. It comes with USB-C charging port. The world is indeed moving to USB-C. Great step by Lenovo for including USB-C charging port.It was manufactured in September - 2020. That's coolSo final words:You don't have to think again about this just go for it trust me."
4,"Its good so far,built quality i love it, best part is keyboard you will love typing on it,i am facing some heating issues on the bottom side on the laptop near air inlet vents, but that maybe be because i use in on my lap or on bed.but is you can elevate the laptop somehow and let the air flow normally, there is no issue then.battery life is 5.5 hrs aprox ( half hr +/-).for now its going really greati havent played games in it yet (not much of a gamer), will update about it, but its i5 so normal gaming should not be a problem.other wise very good productjust that i get only 11 months warranty, i dont know whylets hope i dont face any issue in it within a year or else it will be very disappointing.and yes Display is IPS so no viewing angles issues faces in it, its amazing."
2,"The item description mentiones one year on site warranty but when I did first power on the latop today 7/5/21(same is the date of delivery), it shows only 5 month of warranty remaining.This is totally unacceptable."
1,The laptop which i got whose warranty start date already started 6 months which was supposed to show as the day I ordered the item which is very disappointing and please correct this issue in future.
4,"Pros:This laptop build quality is very good.Looks slim and light.Value for money.Good for professional and home use.Cons:RAM upgradation is costly because of only 1 slot in this laptop.Premier warranty is missing as mentioned in the product page.RAM management is not good, lot of pre installed software which consumes extra RAM memory."
3,Harman audio speakers... Is just a SCAM in this laptop... Other things are doing fine.... I don't know but if I buy a laptop with a value like this.. I am going by it from showroom s . Worst experience till now..Amazon plz stop fooling people. We buy things with money ... If u can't deliver genuine product then don't sell them üôèüôè
1,Do not order from this seller. You won‚Äôt get full warranty. I had a replacement twice and both the times only 5 months warranty was given. Hence returned the product.
3,"I had used a ThinkPad earlier & I liked that experience. Coming back to this one after 3 week usage. It's a good option for day to day usage. Boots up quickly, it's responsive & fast enough. There is no lag or hiccups during operation. Screen is ok. It's not premium. Build quality is decent. Speakers definitely not Harman as they claim. Rather they are Synaptics. One thing does bother me is fan noise (especially in quite room). Battery life not as expected. It hardly lasts for 3-4 hours.....at the max 5? It could suffice one's need for an decent machine for day to day usage & little bit multi-tasking. After sales service is terribly bad. India team response will take days. You wouldn't get any response to tickets created for days."
4,Likes:1. Backlight Keyboard2. Harman tuned speakers3. Slim profile4. Build quality5. LAN portDislike:1. Poor camera2. Getting warranty for 10 months only. I got the product on 1st Jan 2021 but warranty is already activated on October 2020 which is not at all acceptable.
1,I'm hearing hard-disk click sounds. Really pathetic to see Amazon is delivering faulty pieces.Lenovo Touchpads are not good. I mean it is normal to get fingers sweaty it kind of hang and start moving here and there with sweaty finger. Very poor quality. You need ti have a mouse if you want to work with this laptop.Not worth the price. Keyboard is okay touchpad sucks
5,"Got this laptop with IPS display, Indeed a great laptop for multitasking for high bandwidth users, I have been using the same in office with TN display which has very narrow viewing angle but this is feast to the eyes with great viewing angle, and excellent contrast.Black is Black not gray."

5,"This is small review for Potential buyers of Lenovo idea pad 3 (2021) Ryzen 5500u version 82KT00BXIN and why I chose it over HP 1030AU (5500U) -1. Its build quality is decent. Body is made up of PC + ABS (Top), PC + ABS (Bottom). It is not metal or aluminium. I had bad experience with metallic Laptop (HP) where there was current and electric shock in laptop. So ABS is good if not better.2. RAM is 4GB Soldered DDR4-3200 + 4GB SO-DIMM DDR4-3200 dual channel RAM Setup. So max RAM can be 12GB3. Storage is latest 512GB SSD M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0x4 NVMe  not SATA and it supports Up to 2 drives, 1x 2.5"" HDD + 1x M.2 2242/2280 SSD. So HDD can be put.4. WLAN + Bluetooth‚Ñ¢ is latest version11ac, 2x2 (wifi 6) + BT5.05. Office Home and Student 2019 is lifetime free after registration6. Finger print sensor is present which works good7. Privacy shutter is there8. Fast charging support is there ‚Äì charges 80% in 60 minWhy I chose over HP 1030AU (5500U)1. It is almost 2-3 thousand cheaper2. Wifi 6 in idea pad vs wifi 53. Blutooth newer version is present in ideapad (v5 vs 4.2)4. Privacy shuter in idea pad5. Dual channel (4+4gb 3200MHz) better than 8GB Single channel6. Finger print sensor7. Better Screen ‚Äì 300Nits Anti glare IPS Screen vs 250 Nits ips panel.8. Can add extra HDD in idea pad. Not sure about Hp 1030.RAM is Samsung brand and SSD is Micron brand."
5,"Lemme make things easy for you, I will discuss various points to give you a full idea about this machine.Previously I ordered MSI Morden 14 ryzen model but cancelled it when the product was near my home because this Lenovo Ideapad was just listed on Amazon and the specs were unbelievable it was way too much for a 52k laptop especially from Lenovo. Who is know for cost-cutting?1.DisplayWow, it's amazing. it was hard to believe that I got display quality as expected I also have Lenovo legion and trust me the display on this laptop is better than my legion. No colour shift, very little screen bleeding, no dead pixel, best viewing angles. etc overall I love this IPS diaplay.Note:- I don't do colour accuracy-related work I am a web developer and mostly do coding or watch anime or YouTube.So if anyone is looking for this laptop for designing purpose. Sorry, I can't give an appropriate answer.2.Battery lifeIt is mention for around 6 hours. But I am getting around 4-5 hrs on power-saving mode display brightness 70%.And on full 100% brightness 2-3hr maximum.Which is good but could have been better.While coding I got 5hr while continues using in Power saving mode. Its battery life is decent.3.ProcessorI am not an expert in this segment but I can say that it's faster than intel i5 11th gen.Ryzen 5 5500u comes with the Redon 7 graphics 2GB, which occupy 2GB RAM. But I didn't feel any lag nor heating issue. I opened multiple chrome tabs and didn't feel any lag. Ryzen 5 5500u gives a buttery smooth experience while working.4. Build qualityIt's amazing doesn't feel like a 52k laptop feels like a 60-70k laptop.5.speakerIt's Dolby atmos which gives a decent sound.I got this laptop for 52k I think the price will go up as this laptop comes with an MRP of 67000/-So buy it before too much price hike. I am sure you will not regret this.Thank you üòÅüòá"
5,Everything is great if ur budget allow you buy it without thinking twice.There is only one problem if u try to buy extended warranty for this on buyalenovo.com the MTM number is not valid there... this may be because it is newly launched. Hope it will get fixed soon. Otherwise you have to spend extra bucks for extra warranty.Why buyalenovo.comBecause u get great deal on extended warranty. 1499 for 3 year....2499  for 1year premium +ADP +3 yearWithout that 1799 for extra 1 year which is much more.
5,First impressions are ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êDisplay amazing super bright viewing angles are amazing.Boot time is less than 8 seconds.
5,Awesome laptop.
4,"Some cons:1. As this has integrated graphics, so you'll get only 5.86 usable RAM. Rest 2048 MB is for graphic card. However, so far it suffices my requirements, and performance is also good so far as per my usage (I still have to install some applications). There is no option to shrink in the allocated memory for graphic card.EDIT:- You can change it in BIOS settings upto 7.5GB.2. 45% NTSC. Should have 75%. (Laptop NOT recommended if you're buying for photoshop/video editing)3. Lid does not feel metallic. Overall poor build quality. (Although the laptop is steady, it's just cheap plastic feeling is so bad üòê)4. Not a Con though, just FYI - 475 GB storage available."
4,"Laptop is sleek in design, ergonomically designed keypad, good aesthetics.  Shutter for camera & fingerprint reader and good utilities! Initial setup and installations were breezy.  Watched India vs NZ WTC final on Hotstar in Google Chrome.  Sound was quite good & deep; didn't feel as if I was viewing it on laptop; seemed more like connected to an external Bluetooth speaker.Overall response is fast & zippy - thanks to 512GB SSD & Ryzen 5."
1,"I recently purchased this product from Amzon. But I received damaged display. I thought initially that it's a driver issue but later lenovo support team confirmed that display has been internally damaged. This is the 2nd time, I have received damaged product from same vendor. I will highly recommend to cross check everything at the first place when unboxing."
5,"Took a risk by buying without any reviews as it was newly launched and I'm Happy that my decision turns to be great.Essentially, this is the best laptop unfer 55-60k, with great display, amazing cores performance, effecient RAM and CPU utilisation and boot time.If your budget is between 50-60k, then this would make a great choice.The Only downside, which infact doesn't bother me much is, it's downfiring speakers, which isn't as loud as one would expect but then I have headphones to compensate for that.Overall, a great value for your buck."
5,"Price - I bought it for INR 51,800. First of all I am not an expert in laptops. Basic stuff like processor, clock speed, RAM etc. is all I looked at before I zeroed in on this. I have not used many laptops. So my review is a standalone review on this laptop.The reason I selected this laptop is1. I found it to be the cheapest among the laptops with similar specs.2. Higher battery life - 6-7 hours on paper which is much higher than competition at this range. I am yet to test this out (at the time of this review) as I got the laptop yesterday and used for 6-7 hours with the wire plugged in.3. 5 star rating by the other users.First impression1. Amazing feel. The laptop looks sleek and the build quality looks good2. It starts from shutdown almost instantly3. Soft keyboard touch (which was not even a criteria for me). I have another latest laptop from dell (however its i3 processor). The feel from this keyboard is better than that from Dell laptop. Basically you will fall in love with typing.4. Screen is amazing. I played a 4k video on it yesterday and the FHD IPS display does its job5. I am not sure about the sound though. At full volume it is not as loud I think. But then when playing video on laptop I always use a speaker or headphones (so inconsequential to me)All in all my rating says it all!The FHD IPS is screen is amazing. I played some 4k videos on it and it was mind boggling."
4,After 12 hours of usage I am writing this review:Processing speed super. Display quality awesome. Very good backlit keyboard. Battery backup descent. Fast charging. Elegant design.I deducted 1 star for sound and touchapd. Sound quality very good but sound is extremely low. You can not hear anything if cooler or fan is running and touchpad looks fragile.The laptop is not so strong as my 10 years old lenovo Y570.But you will really love the speed and performance of Ryzen processor.
4,"Good fast laptop at a reasonable price. The features provided are mostly found on a grade higher laptops. Key board backlight, finger print sensor, 300 nits bright screen antiglare with win 10 and office pre installed.There are few cons I noticed for example the bios auto reserves 2 gb of ram because of that the usable ram becomes 6 gb. I think service center people are not aware of a solution. But you can reduced the reserved memory to 512 mb so that you have 7+ gb useable ram.Update after a months use:Pro1. Fast laptop for normal use.2. Battery back up is really good gives around 5+ hrs.3. Finger print sensor is super fast unlock really fast.Con:1. Speaker volume is low. You need to be in a quite room to hear anything clearly.2. Not sure if its AMD/ or because of no dedicated graphics card. Effective ram available for use is 7 gb."
4,"Update :As only available RAM was 5.9 GB, 2.1 G is taken by GPU. so if you are not planning to increase RAM and less in Gaming, then you can increase the available RAM to your other process.  After change in bios setting, now available RAM to OS is 7.4 G.Pros:It's a beast interm of performance. Initially thought finger print sensor is just a fancy add.on but I am liking it the most. Boot time is super fast.Battery backup is good, also charging is quick.Cons:AVAIALBLE RAM is just under 6G, which is drawback, if you open many chrome tabs and few other apps then RAM starts hovering around 90%.Speakers not so good. Camera is okay is.Overall given the price point, you won't get such a feature rich laptop"
5,"Awesome laptop.. it's responding very fast.. one problem I am facing is with warranty..I ordered the laptop on 27/June, but the warrenty started on 16/June.. And Amazon support says they can't do anything apart from replacement (which I don't want, as the laptop is currently out of stock)Update : I am able to change the start date in the lenovo site. So now the warrenty has started on correct date."
5,"The product is really nice, the color, keyboard, display and almost everything is perfect. The only complain I had was the warranty policy, I purchased the product(with 1year warranty policy) on 27th June but the warranty policy starts from 14th June, I hope that amazon solves up that problem."
4,"Grab it. Trust me you won't regret. If you are looking this laptop for study, coding, meetings, online classes, watching movies, sports n all. This is the best choice in this budget. I am not a gamer so no idea about gaming performance.Super smooth, good sized keyboard with backlit, 14"" screen, antiglare, fingerprint reader, webcam shutter.You won't get anything better than this in this price range of 52k. If you have old laptop you can get exchange as well. And if you have Amaozon pay ICICI card you will get no cost EMI as well for 3 or 6 months.1 star deducted just for sound loudness, quality is good btw. I think that is not a deal breaker because most of the time we use headset or bluetooth speaker."

5,"Best Laptop in 50K range, using it for past 15 days playing youtube in 4k and doing coding stuff and it is taking everything easily.Some PROS---Laptop boots up in seconds very fast.Screen quality is great.Keyboard is goodCan handle multi tasking very easily (opening more than 10tabs and no lags so far)Nice comfortable finish when carrying the laptopGreat connectivity (Bluetooth/ Wifi/ Wireless Monitor connection all works fineSound is not great and not too bad either depends on what video is playing.Battery is great once charged 100% can last upto 6 hours without shutting down.Only CON--Touch Pad does not feels great when using , you can connect external mouse not a big issue."
1,"Received product yesterday,  1/4 of the screen has green colour..defective piece received, complained to Amazon waiting for return/replacement."
3,I like the overall performance. Except for the sound issue sometimes speaker stops working and after restart starts working again. Not sure it's hardware issue or software. Will contact lenovo customer service and update the experience.
5,"This product has the features and specifications that we generally see on a 60k laptop.The differentiator that makes slim 3 superior to its big brother is the upgradable ram which lacks in slim 5 , also costing almost 10k cheaper is the main highlight.Comparison with other product of this price range (hp 14) , it gives more features like anti glare display , backlit keyboard, fingerprint.It has 8 GB Ram out of which 6GB is usable while other 2 GB acts as GPU memory , so it can also handle decent gaming performance.This setting can be changed in bios if you want to use the full 8 GB memory as RAM.Overall a complete and best package at this price."
4,"Washed out and faded colors when comparing with smartphone video quality. Specially notice in animation video. Red look Orange and white look creamy. Calibrated color using AMD Radeon setting. Still no use.Build, Design, performance, battery, features are good."
4,This is one of the best for students. The iGPU on this one is better than the intel version. This one can play most games at an acceptable fps. Video editing can be done easily. It has 6 cores and 12 threads. It is damn fast. The SSD is lovely. And the design is plastic but feels premium. I expected a better unboxing experience but it was enough.
4,"Only available ram is 5.76 of 8 Gb. 2 gb of ram is taken by the processor for graphics support. This is how rayzen5 5500U processor works, majority of ryzen U series works this way. All other is good with this laptop under budget. Battery backup is pretty good, camera quality is average."
5,Good laptop at reasonable price.
5,The display is great and the build is strong compact and lightweight that's the best part of this laptop very easy to carry this laptop while traveling battery backup could have been a bit better and the power of Ryzen 5500U is is amazing you will not regret buy this if your task is office work and entertainment.And yes the speakers have really low sound audio quality should have been better.
5,"For around 52 thousand, It is completely worth it when we compared to other products.I'm happy with the following features.. Clock speed.  Free Microsoft office..  Batter life."
5,I bought this laptop one week ago.It was very nice for this price.I am extremely happy for this .light weight and its working and build quality is very very nice..thank you. Go for this laptop if you are opted for study purpose.you will never disappointed.
5,"Writing this after using the laptop for two days. Everything in this is laptop is beyond wht i expected. Performance is great, display is very good and anti glare as well. Keyboard response is also very good. The only con is it's a bit on the heavier side. Overall I'll say for 52k it's an amazing deal."

5,"This product has the features and specifications that we generally see on a 60k laptop.The differentiator that makes slim 3 superior to its big brother is the upgradable ram which lacks in slim 5 , also costing almost 10k cheaper is the main highlight.Comparison with other product of this price range (hp 14) , it gives more features like anti glare display , backlit keyboard, fingerprint.It has 8 GB Ram out of which 6GB is usable while other 2 GB acts as GPU memory , so it can also handle decent gaming performance.This setting can be changed in bios if you want to use the full 8 GB memory as RAM.Overall a complete and best package at this price."
4,"Washed out and faded colors when comparing with smartphone video quality. Specially notice in animation video. Red look Orange and white look creamy. Calibrated color using AMD Radeon setting. Still no use.Build, Design, performance, battery, features are good."
4,This is one of the best for students. The iGPU on this one is better than the intel version. This one can play most games at an acceptable fps. Video editing can be done easily. It has 6 cores and 12 threads. It is damn fast. The SSD is lovely. And the design is plastic but feels premium. I expected a better unboxing experience but it was enough.
4,"Only available ram is 5.76 of 8 Gb. 2 gb of ram is taken by the processor for graphics support. This is how rayzen5 5500U processor works, majority of ryzen U series works this way. All other is good with this laptop under budget. Battery backup is pretty good, camera quality is average."
5,Good laptop at reasonable price.
5,The display is great and the build is strong compact and lightweight that's the best part of this laptop very easy to carry this laptop while traveling battery backup could have been a bit better and the power of Ryzen 5500U is is amazing you will not regret buy this if your task is office work and entertainment.And yes the speakers have really low sound audio quality should have been better.
5,"For around 52 thousand, It is completely worth it when we compared to other products.I'm happy with the following features.. Clock speed.  Free Microsoft office..  Batter life."
5,I bought this laptop one week ago.It was very nice for this price.I am extremely happy for this .light weight and its working and build quality is very very nice..thank you. Go for this laptop if you are opted for study purpose.you will never disappointed.
5,"Writing this after using the laptop for two days. Everything in this is laptop is beyond wht i expected. Performance is great, display is very good and anti glare as well. Keyboard response is also very good. The only con is it's a bit on the heavier side. Overall I'll say for 52k it's an amazing deal."
3,Amazon has sent the product which was defective. Unfortunetly amazon has provided wrong invoice.... pls check again may you have also received the wrong invoice. hp said give correct invoice or no warranty. I asked customer service they said provide photo and all and till now no  correct invoice is provided and my dead product of 79000 is kept with me. Daily calls with customer service and they were befooling. If invoice is wrong its a fraud technically....And now i realize some day we may  get into some legal issue....Update:- finally amazon provided me the correct invoice and after multpile hickups my product got returned... . it was done but very very late and i have noticed some customer service really helped me otherwise i would have kept the product as it is.Infact while returning also the person asked so many questions before return.Nothing was smooth....but yes money saved.....
4,"Pros-1. 16:10 aspect ratio with 13.3 inch screen(atleast for me)2. Good keyboard with proper spaces between the keys and decent key travel. Trackpad is large.3. Latest ryzen processor4. No heating problem at all even after using 4-5 hours of use with the charger plugged in.5. Metal body(except the lid which is plastic)6. Colours look good, black is deeper with good contrast and negligible screen leaking.7. Fingerprint sensor(nowadays it is available in every laptop in this range though)8. Upgradable to windows 119. 16 MB cache memory!!10. Could use the omen gaming hub if you want to play some heavy games on this(not recommended)Cons-1. Average battery life(around 5-6 hours depending upon brightness and type of usage, it can increase upto 7-8 hours too)2. Average sound( clarity is there but speakers are lacking in loudness, although more than enough if you just want to attend the online classes or attend meetings and listen to music, but you could face problems while watching movies in certain conditions)3. RAM not expandable(although it is enough to get the job done even in graphics intensive work)4. Wish it could support the windows hello camera. Also I would have liked to see a better camera which supports beyond just 720P.Conclusion:A premium build laptop with good display quality, very good for multitasking functionalities which can match mac book air with m1 chip for most of the tasks( incase you were wondering if you should buy macbook after coming this far in price point)It's not perfect but certainly tending to it."
4,"Light as a feather, looks sleek af. Price to performance ratio depends on your budget and usage. A tad bit expensive but fits me perfectly, do your research before buying it for yourself."
1,For a pavilion laptop with ryzen processor this laptop is grossly overpriced. The battery is just 43wh which gives you 5-6 hours of heavy usage. hp i5  11th gen laptop with 16gb ram is priced at 66k. Only change is aspect ratio and screen to body ratio.
5,"Super light laptop, only .97 kg and u won't feel like carrying it.. just like a notebook in ur hand.And the pic quality is amazing with true sRGB.Very good laptop for professional works like eclipse, Android SDK, Jmeter testing etc..I ran all these with heavy load input and it works without any problem. The AMD ryzen 5600 is amazing. Far better than intel i7 I felt.16GB ram with integrated graphics core is more than enough for anything else.Played Asphalt game with full options and worked fine.Am not a gamer hence didn't try other super heavy games.The screen size is perfect for me, 13.3"" is the best I like.i have 2 more laptops from hp, 15"" and 14""...but now am liking 13"" since it's very compact and easy to put inside bag along ur notebooks."
5,"The rose gold looks stunning ü§© It is the best ultrabook by hp.Performance - AMD 5600u can handle any task such as video editing, coding , ERP software etcDisplay - Best quality display no issues in outdoor and you can work continuously on it no problem for your eyes.Battery üîã: Battery backup is awesome. For coding gives 8-10 hr backup, entertainment such as watching Netflix, Amazon Prime gives 6-8hr, Multitasking - Coding + listening music + downloading any item + video editing then gives 4-6 hours.Keyboard - it is awesome typing experience is flagship level also the backlight is very good in rose gold color"
4,"Due to my work requirements, I need Windows 10 Professional (Remote Desktop and Domain membership), and the pre-installed ""Windows 10 Home - whatever"" edition could not be upgraded so I had to format it and install Windows 10 Professional from scratch, but formatting and installing Windows 10 Professional went without a hitch.The only problem I face is that the built in Realtek WIFI adapter keeps on losing the connectivity. I move from one conference room to another with the laptop, and even within my 2 floor home, I move from one room / floor to another room / floor with a different access point / router, it loses connectivity and thinks that ""No Networks are available"". Disabling/Enabling the adapter, Sleep/Wake up, Hibernate/UnHibernate does not work. But after full shutdown and reboot it finds the networks. I have decided to live with it because it is practically impossible to get any customer service with this product.So I bought one of those nano WIFI adapters for <INR 500 (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B008IFXQFU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1 )and stuck it in the SB Port, disabled the onboard RealTek WIFI adapter and things are ok now."
5,Good for those who are looking for a easily portable and lightweight laptop.This laptop can handle all the tasks smoothly except high end gaming and the tasks that requires high GPU  usage.Keyboard typing experience and screen quality is very nice.80 to 25 percentage drop in battery can be expected in about 5 to 6 hours under the usage like internet browsing and video playback.
5,"Really great laptop for students, ultra light weight for carrying around, good screen quality, great battery life giving nearly10-12 hours during various runs."
4,"A powerful laptop, but delicate structure"
5,Best price n light weight
4,Lightweight.Best performance. I use it for coding.All heavy software works fine.Looks premiumCons -Speaker sound is lowWifi range issue. Always need to keep laptop near router.
5,Best laptop at the price point with no heating issues
5,BEST LAPTOP UNDER 80000
5,Good product for developer.
5,"Best for light gaming , programming, coding.and multitasking. very best for contain consuming or watching Netflix or videos.You must have to go for this."
1,Horrible experience with the laptop. First of all I received one product which was a used one then asked for a replacement and now the new one has keyboard issue and Spacebar issue. Don't buy HP laptops these are terrible. Not sure whether it is a fault of the vendor or HP but my experience is terrible with this.
4,"I was looking for a desktop replacement for my home use. Not a hardcore gamer, just a guy who played games like COD, Project IGI, GTA, different NFS titles in college and some years after. So while replacing my years old desktop, thought of buying a so called ""gaming laptop"". Requirements were clear - laptop but not necessarily an ultra portable one (as mobile phone works well while on the move), expandable hardware (specially RAM), without any bias for AMD or Intel, have to be fairly latest and must be value for money. Though selected couple of others also from Lenevo and Dell; HP was most value for money of them. And 10th gen Core i5 with 8GB DDR4 (expandable to 16GB for sure), 512GB SSD, 1650Ti graphics card, 15.6 inch FHD display was enough for my need, with a budget of not crossing 60k after all discounts - this laptop is a good fit for my requirements.The laptop build quality is average with full plastic body all around. Be careful, this laptop won't be able to handle a fall. Design wise it looks good whether lid open or closed.Display is crisp and decent for my usage. Its a 60hz display. Avoided UHD or 120-144hz displays purely for budget purpose. Speakers are loud enough and speaker housing has a nice pattern to it adding to overall aesthetics. HD front facing camera is good for video conferencing, though did not use it as such apart from testing it.Keyboard buttons are comfortable and satisfactory to press; but compromised arrow keys and inclusion of num pad makes it annoying to use. Would have liked a full sized keyboard with a compromised or no numpad. Keyboard is backlit, has 2 brightness settings. Purple LED are bright, but would have liked white LED. Trackpad usability is usual and size is ok. Anyway I use the laptop with a Logitech wireless keyboard mouse combo.Enough ports are given. The USB-C port also doubles up as power delivery port (so you can charge a device from it and with supported USB-C charger you can charge the laptop also). SD card slot and 3 full size USB 3.0 ports are enough for connecting number of peripherals to the laptop. Has full size HDMI and RJ45 port for gigabit ethernet.Not talking about performance in details as lots of benchmark is available online. Overall bootup is fast. Handling of games till 2015 are quite good and some can play even in FHD Ultra settings. Photo editing (gimp2) and stitching large panorama also did not face any issue and can process RAW images fast and its evident. Pro tip, use hdmi out to a monitor and switch off laptop screen while playing games, it will give you little better FPS; as hdmi out gets feed directly from dedicated gpu (for laptop screen dedicated gpu's output goes through integrated gpu - read about mux switch which this laptop does not have)Only place where it lacks, is battery backup. I could not get backup more than 3~3.5hrs. I understand for gaming I cannot expect back up like that, but would have liked around 5hrs backup at least for normal use like simple photo editing or browsing or using other productivity/office tool.Comes with 150watt power adaptor. Charges it quick but heats up quite enough. Did not try charging with USB-C port yet. In normal use it is silent but while gaming fans comes on and they are noisy but not intrusive. Game's sound hide fan noise anyway.HP laptop comes with some bloatware, some unnecessary mini games and app are preinstalled. Please note, this laptop does not come with licensed MS Office. Its preinstalled with Windows 10 Home (OEM) version, however did not face any issue upgrading it to Windows 10 Pro by linking with my existing digital license.Overall satisfied mainly due to the performance and value for money offering."
5,AFTER 10 DAYS OF USAGE:Perfect for gaming at default settings. i5 10th gen. Processor works great. Gem at 70k budgetHaving issue with battery life as it last long 1.30 hrs on heavy usage and 2hrs on power saving mode. So you need to plug-in and play games for better gaming and FPS*
1,"While the laptop is very expensive, the product is defective. Frequent flickers with white streaks across screen for a a laptop supposed to have best graphics card and latest screen technology. Hoping Amazon will replace the product, waiting for Amazon technician to come after 5 days of receiving and reporting the problem. Extremely disappointed with both HP and Amazon."
5,"Best performance laptop under 70k.... better performance, good for gaming, good performance in Editing.... Battery lasts more than 3.5 hours with continuous useage with internet (without gaming and editing)......display was good graphic designers can go for it......No heating issues at all...speaker is clear, crisp and awesome it's a different experience on speakers..... hardware is quite good... Design as expected in pictures...(If laptop lags update windows)OverallGood for gamingGood for EditingGood for graphic designing"
5,"It is a very good laptop at this price range. The speed and performance is good and can be used for multiple purposes other than gaming, like video-editing , photoshop, office work etc. The speed can be enhanced by adding additional RAM. (Most compatible RAM for this model)"
5,I wanted a laptop with high tech spec but under 70000 range for my heavy workloads. It's absolutely the best one. So far so good. Windows 11 is also upgraded freely automatically as per the Microsoft schedule. I didn't try this for gaming as that was not my intent of this purchase. Build quality is good and not too heavy.  I will recommend this for anyone wants to buy this for heavy workloads using GPU along with mix of SSD and HDD storage with expandable RAM.
5,Very nice laptop...powerfull for gamming...sound and display quality is also good... running smooth... boot time takes around 5-8 sec... thanx to 512gb ssd... and the intel optane in superd we can use total of 40 gb as system memory
5,"Probably the best gaming laptop you can get for this budget. Gives 50-60fps for most games on high settings. Load times are incredibly fast, and it does not overheat. The battery life is on the lower side. Do not expect more than 3 hours of usage on a single charge while using a video calling app like zoom."
1,warranty already started from 3 months before purchase date. how it possible.
5,Video Player is loading.
1,Bought a hp gaming laptop yesterday. Display was dead on arrival. Sought a replacement. Never thought hp laptop would be of such a poor quality.
1,"Today I received the laptop. After entering serial number and product id on hp site it shows Warranty started 6 months before from purchase date, that is from june 2021 and only 6 month remaining. Shows already registered and used. Fraudulent dealer. Don't buy online."
1,"I got the laptop defected, but I already transferred all my data into it and the technician which was called by Amazon only is not coming and gave excuses, I have called a technician twice., The I key is uplifted and there is this broken blinking light on the side. DONT BUY"
5,"Very impressive design and build quality performance is best in this price segment, sound quality is awesome and display is excellent also battery life is also normal, gaming performance is excellent no doubt"
2,"The device overall holds a decent look .But the hinge quality is not good .Its so soft that if you keep it in front of a table fan the screen would start shaking.No option for performance modes .Just traditional battery options in windows .The product comes with installed with omen gaming hub which is pretty useless ,since you can't alter performance with it."
4,"almost all functions are exceptional. Battery backup is fair it can be be understood as it's gaming laptop. Lapy is loaded with features and space, you can't think to buy such machine in this price, so go for it, I have got it in sale at 62k price in emi."
5,"If you are going for basic editing or modeling or simple gamming its good for you but you are going for hardcore gamming get a 3050 and a 16gb ram one and if you are going for a hardcore editing or modeling you should go with ryzen 6core or 8core prosessor and 3050 and 16 gb ram .Its good for basic useage as in it can do video editing and can run a lot of modpacks and games like valorant and csgo at hdBut if you want to explode thounds of TNT or do 4k video editing or play games at 4k go with a better one . if you do 4k gaming better than 3050 , like 3050 to or 3060 .It has 3 3.0 usb ports. 3.0 means faster data transfer. And 1 mic / headphone jack port . and charging and battery backup are good ."
3,Bought this so I could okay NFS heat. But very disappointed that it doesn't even support the medium graphics in the game. The game starts to stutter and lag ..
5,"It was a value for money purchase, since i returned my old compaq lap for 4 k and i got this laptop for 58k...indeed a nice deal.. isn't it?About battery life..since i m not a heavy gamer i use this laptop for the daily routines like checking mails office work listing ro music , but still i feel that the battery drains fast unless u put it on to power saving mode. Still on power saving mode it doesn't last long enough. I can give only a rating of 3 out of 5 for battery...i extremely liked this laptop except its battery performance."
1,My laptop became dead after 18 days and service centre told motherboard issue and after 5 days also they are not doing anything.. Too nonsense..
5,"Good value for money.Processor and graphics card don't lag until you do some extreme graphics gaming. Good for beginner to moderate gamers.I also do coding, no issues there too.Battery life feels a little less as it lasts about 3.5 to 4 hours.Speakers are loud and clear. Touchpad and keyboard is good.Little heavy to carry and fits exactly in regular backpacks.It looks very nice."
4,Overall its a good product. The specifications at this price range is competitive. Other brands or models with this specs are around 6-8k costlier.Only drawback i can see is the battery life. Battery runs out in between 1 to 1.5 hours.
5,"First update BIOS,and windows.You will see good battery back up.Else you will see battery drains within one hour.I am not playing games. For coding simulation purpose its performance is good."
5,"Bought this a week back.Except for the weak battery life, this laptop is value for money.It has a decent graphics card to run games like RDR2 at 30-50 fps, Forza Horizon 4 at 65-70 fps on ultra settings. Older games run even better. The build is decent. Overall a good buy under 70k"
5,Bang for the buck.... This machine is üî•üî•No heating issue at all and the this laptop is smooth af giving great fps during heavy gaming.
4,Over All product is very good...Gaming Good..Build Quality Good.Keypad well designed ...Track pad quality is okay okay  better use mouse for best performance.
5,"Battery life is short.Rest all is very good, fast loading , easy to use, design and many more.Buy it if you want for normal use at reasonable cost."
4,"For this price range, this is one of the best products to opt for if you are interested in gaming/online class/daily chores, basically for students and regular use."
4,I liked the feel and touch...Small track pad..Good screen ...Seems fineWill update..
4,Not bad.But no battery life
5,Nice product
1,Never buy this product display flickring within one month very bad service even service centre not picup
4,"Allover laptop is good but the battery part is worst . Battery drains so quickly even if I only play a song , it is last for just 2hrs more or less ."
5,I found nothing to dislike. And I like everything about it.
5,AWESOME
1,This product has been delivered without any p reinstalled window. The key of the window is also missing. A disgusting product.
4,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).Clarifications/issue points:1. It‚Äôs a plastic body and not aluminium.2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.4. There‚Äôs no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it‚Äôs body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.Pros:1. Configuration is best at this price level.2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.4. It‚Äôs light weight as it‚Äôs a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.6. Display is average and gets the job done.7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it‚Äôs expandable upto 1 TB.9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it‚Äôs a really well thought product by HP.I‚Äôll update this review after one month of usage."
1,"Different charger was sent in the box by Amazon and they were not ready to provide a replacement as I had open the laptop box.Later after several calls and struggle I was able to get the replacement and now, camera is not working for the laptop.Laptop's over-all performance is nice. Buy it from a HP showroom directly instead buying it from Amazon."
5,"Amazing laptop.. I ordered this laptop on its released date i.e. 24th feb seeing it's wonderful configuration.. I must say the decision was right..Thank u HP for this superfast laptop. And after so much of research, I think in HP this is the only laptop with high configuration (11th gen, 16gb ram, 512 SSD, 14 inch screen, light weight, finger sensor & Alexa inbuilt) under this budget."
2,"If you are a College student or a professional who depends heavily on laptop for pretty much everyday then  this laptop is not for you. It hangs more often than it runs. Cannot install essential computer science software such as Eclipse or android studio because then this laptop just dies.I took this laptop thinking that it will have good performance based on its configuration.But if you are someone who wants to attend online classes or just browse, then you may go for this laptop."
1,"The battery is gone in a month's time it was delivered on 5-Apr-201, hardware diagnosis says battery needs to be replaced. Have already faced issues where the keys just froze and had to contact support team."
1,"Good laptop with a decent hardware spec, was able try out some heavy graphics games and sever configuration. The disappointment was the promised MS word processing software with life long validity. Where the seller did not share the product key. This is a common scenario as many other buyers are also complaining. License software subscription is around INR 1200 per year, so please factor in that also in ur owner ship cost.Again this kind of behaviour from one of the reputed sellers on the platform is disappointing."
5,11 Gen Laptop with 16GB RAM is a dream combination as of now. Good deal
5,"Awesome features in this laptopScreen is delight, back lit keyboard is awesome, finger print recognition is really good. I cannot imagine I could get all these features at this price. Super fast drive, free office what else you need.... 16 gb ramBeen using this for more than 2 weeks.. I am really really happy. On top of it awesome customer care service on what's app"
4,HP Pavilion laptop is slim & look premium. It's design as similar to Apple Macbook Air. I had a another HP Pavilion laptop but it had a complaint that if you open the lap the keyboard cover will slightly bend. This HP Pavilion laptop solve it's problem.Advantage1. Light Weight2. Slim Body3. Great Display & Camera4. Enriched Bang & Olufsen sound5. Output heat is place between screenDisadvantage1. To make laptop slim they had to remove Lan/Ethernet2. The Key are white. Some time we have to turn off to see the letter of the key3. Need to buy Adapter for Lan/Ethernet supply4. There are 2 USB  & One Type C USB. If u need to connect more device buy a5. Some time it is hard to physical connect to USB AConclusion: Since it has some drawback. I did buy the product for it's price & it's Brand Also. I loved it
4,"I just see one month trial version of microsoft 365, it doesn't show me option to setup ms office. can some one help me on this?"
5,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue."
5,"This is an excellent product. Appearance looks great. Start and shutdown in a blink due to NVMe SSD. All the configurations including RAM, processor, ports are well tested and optimized. Very light waight and portable for frequent travellers."
4,Quality of the laptop seems to be more premium and the lightweight of the laptop fits to our hand. I am not a gamer for normal usage it seems best in class. HP had worked very well in this series with good quality speakers and keyboards are nice power. On and off in lightening speed with the ssd  but the only disadvantage is the internal webcam which makes me very disappointed . its just a hd camera. For this price range HP should work on the camera section. overall nice product.
1,"A bad choice purchase from amazon. After a week of use, the laptop screen display goes off every 5 to 10 minutes. When it goes off, I need to switch the laptop on, the display comes back and after 5 minutes again goes off, again switch it on.  Tired of it. Frustrated. Don't buy electronics from Amazon."
4,This is my first laptop and i love it !... It turn on within in fraction of seconds..Pros :1) 16 gigs of RAM & i 5 11 gen processor gives the butter smooth experience.2) Excellent battery lifeCons:Touch pad should be more precise
1,Had an issue with the product and the HP service support is horrible.I have called their support number about 10 times and written multiple emails. It‚Äôs been more than 10 days and nothing much has happened.Now the laptop is jst a piece of waste affecting my kids online school.
4,"Cons:This laptop has rectangular display and if you were using MacBook 13, you might get surprised to see this screen feels smaller than that. So I suggest checking this out in physical store before buying.I did not like the mouse trackpad as it‚Äôs not very responsive and sometimes gives wrong feedback.Battery is decent, If not the best.Pros:Thin, sleek, lightweight and handy.Windows package is good with free office.Laptop in general is quite fast"
5,"I had given a good review earlier but 40 days later it is different story altogether. HP black screen problem is all pervading. I have installed no softwares nothing that could harm computer, but it is giving me ride for the day. No amount of customer response is helping.  I have scheduled for on site visit. Let's see where it goes.Switch to apple if you can afford."
5,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. The box contains the laptop and the charging cable. The laptop weighs  exactly 1.4 KG, and it's quite nice. It has all the specifications as advertised, i.e. 16 GB ram, and 500 GB NVME SSD. It does not have IR camera so no face unlocking will support. The finger print sensor is fast. Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both. Battery life is not completely tested but it's fairly ok, as of now I have got backup worth of definitely 6 hrs."
1,"In just 6 month, Laptop‚Äôs charging pin short circuited and burned the port as well.HP claims 1 year manufacturer‚Äô warranty which is a JOKE guys, beware of that.Reached out to HP but they being a fraudster company Denied the manufacturer warranty , reasoning they don't cover accidents and Asked around 10 k for chargeable service.Common, your product quality sucks man , own it up. Your charger pin short circuited without any liquid spill or moisture.I have a 8 year old Dell laptop, and a 6 year old Acer . Both had no issues in the same house hold.I will never trust this company again.Cheap company , cheap product and utterly disappointing service.It will work like charm UNTIL it can, and then the HP will start drilling more holes in your pocket ."
3,The system heats up a lot during normal usage or even when kept idle. Rest all seems ok as of now. Boots fast and good at multitask. Expected a privacy shutter for web cam at this price. Privacy concerned people pls buy one from amazon.
3,"Pros:It is light weight, good graphics and configuration.Cons:But not worth of the cost. The touch pad is pathetic and very unconfortable to use.Battery life ok not great. Camera quality not good.Over all this was my first HP buy!. Earlier I had Dell laptop and comparatuvely HP has very delicate and no fun Hardware. I regreting the deciaion to opt HP!!"
5,Best laptop at this price. I have never seen such a display on the laptops I have ever used. The battery is also something. For me (with some power saving tweeks) the battery lasted for about 7 hours after a full charge.The performance has no match at this price. Only problem I seen is the ram expandability. It's can only be expanded to 12 gbs.
1,"I found some software probleam in this laptop like gmail signout probleam, fingerprints, some time in keybord,etc..."
5,Very nice product üëçüòä thnkuu for this amazing product.... I hope it will be working in future like that.
1,BAD PACKAGING/ SCRATCHES ON THE SCREEN/ LOOKS SLUGGISH/ USED IT FOR 10 HOURS AND THE BATTERY ISNT GOOD AT ALL. DONT BUY THIS LAPTOP GUYS. ITS NOT WORTH A PURCHASE.BAD PRODUCT.
4,I received the package on time and the laptop is absolutely great there is no issue.Clean and clear delivery and guys please for name sake don't comment negative ratings.I have been using it for Official tasks and its performing great.
5,"I like this laptop. Very nice product, but its screen is not good"
3,Speed very less
5,Really good laptop. Flawless. Value for money. Not for gaming. Battery life is ok. Do not go by the negative comments being posted by people.
4,Nice laptop and it is little bit slow
4,It was worth it at the affordable price brilliant performance but the audio is little low but it's perfect for notebook and office use. I would like to say purchase the laptop.
5,After using more then a week laptop working fine I have face no issue no lag also good for normal gaming and video quality of screen also good. Worth buy for office work.
3,"The charger is not working, and the laptop is good."
4,"on first impressions it is a value for money, work well without any lag, slim and sturdy, does not have MS Office, screen resolution is nice, keyboard typing is easy"
3,It works OK it's a bit slow can be made faster by disabling few unnecessary background process. Good for casual use. HDD laptop so slow in bootup also. Good points - does not heat up a lot for casual use battery is also not bad keyboard and looks are also good.

4,So far I don't have any problem
2,"its just about okay for online classes and basic email and document editing but its slow and sluggish, screen quality is bad, you can see aliasing in the letters."
1,"Very poor product, system is too slow and it doesn't work as I expected it too, waste of money, very disappointed, Worst Product Ever, Don't Buy, Very Slow In Opening, Processing and Working, Full Waste of Money, Never Ever Worth It"
1,I had bought the laptop for simple purpose like power point presentation & Excel files. But this laptop is so slow that it takes 25 seconds to open anything. It takes 3 minutes to boot. That to when laptop is not even loaded yet. This laptop is not worth buying at all.
4,Video Player is loading.
1,Got the faulty product. It's look like an unauthorized product. Laptop is working very slow. Display quality is very low. Fonts are looking very different. It's look like a clone product.
1,Very slow and not for business purpose.

4,good laptop in this price range....
5,"After searching a lot I bought this laptop, and then I upgrade it with a 128 gb Nvme m.2pci SSD and 8 gb ddr4 ram, I install windows 10 in 128gb Nvme pci m.2 SSD. Now it's superfast, os opens ready within 7 seconds after pushing power button. All programs run very fast with total 12 gb ram. Total cost to upgrade this about Rs 5100. So within 35k , you may have 12 gb ram plus 1tb and 128 gb total hdd ..I am happy with this product."
1,There's no OS. Also the product cannot be returned once you discover that you have been delivered a shell (a machine with no OS)
5,Not so fast. You'll probably need to add more RAM later that could cost you 1500 for another 4gb. Overall it's fine for the price. Design is good.
1,"I have installed windows 10 OS and installed all drivers related to mouse pad, internet but none of this is working..Really disappointed with the product"
5,The laptops is best for work and school going kids too
1,"Hanging problem, waste of hard earned money"
1,Bad experience with the item. Windows 10 is not installed... Don't buy....
2,U can buy better laptops in this range but don't go for this ...this s an old version of 2007 ...for fast delivery and display only m giving 2 star
2,Touch pad not working
1,Look wise it is fine but not value for money..
4,Good to use
1,"Useless system ever seen, don't buy it"
1,Poor
1,Waste of money..poor battery performance...hanging problem üòí
5,Good
3,Value amount and laptop good....
1,Not interested
1,Dislike
5,1. Great performance on heavy audio editing software.2. superb upgrading capability with both SSD & HDD.3. free SATA cable inside the box.4. Battery performance is ok.
5,Killer speed killer look
5,Excellent laptop. It is beast and highly recommend for gaming and normal use.
5,"I use this for academic purposes. Great feeling, great screen quality, fast."
4,Great configuration. I checked the specs using device manager. Matches the product spec in the description. Acer has included important software of it's own. Nitrosense has good ui but could have provided some tweaks for setting custom cpu frequency along with presets. I can do this in power manager but still one place to do so would be good.Pc health check shows that the system is ready for windows 11.Build quality is not up to the mark. Could be the only minus and one less star.A word about packaging. Thank heavens acer packaged the laptop really well and provided good protection with tear detection stickers. Amazon apprario retail put that in a  bigger box but forgot to tape one end. So the acer box could have come out of the box any time and I would have received an empty big box. I sometimes wonder why amazon bothers to put things in disproportionately sized boxes and forgets to seal it properly. Do the people who handle the packages just tear things apart to see what's inside or is it just the time pressure that they don't care to seal it properly at the beginning?
5,Very good product for anyone purchasing laptop in under budget of Rs 1 Lkh.
5,Good gaming laptop

1,"This laptop is a box of trash, even a tortoise is faster than this processor. Don't go by paid YouTube channels and buy Acer laptops. Don't waste your money, as electronics products it is difficult to get refund and proper replacement."
1,Slow as a sloth...Don't purchase it or will get hassled like me
4,"First of all, the product images in amazon are not totally accurate. The images show a black keyboard with white letters and no fingerprint reader within trackpad. Actual product has silver colored keys with grey letter and there is a fingerprint reader. Refer ASUS official website for correct pics.Things I liked:- Light weight- Bootup and shutdown speeds are good.- Fast fingerprint reader.- Good loud speakers.- Premium look.Things that could have been better..- Display (Viewing angles are not that great. And I observed blue tint. Not sure if this is good for long sessions. I will have to find out.- Keyboard (You cant see the letters on the keys from certain angles or lighting conditions. You will have to lean forward to see the letters. A black keyboard with white letters would have been better)- Camera (Not at all good or I can say useless. I will give 1 out of 5 ratings for Camera)- Left and Right click buttons make cheap clicky sound.Overall I am happy with the product. Giving 4 stars instead of 5, only for the bad camera."
1,I received the laptop in morning didn't start yet after 3 hrs of charging very bad product
5,Excellent
3,"Performance is quite good, But this laptop has battrey and shock issues, using the laptop while charging can give you shock through usb ports which is quite dangerous. And also battrey life is not good, I am using same hp laptop for 10 years and it lasts longer than this Asus vivobook. I am attending a lecture and the battrey drops 71perc to 29 perc in just 1 hour even in power saving modeüôÑüôÑ."
5,"SSD makes function quick. You may or may not add HDD to this lapi along with SSD inside.Internal battery, must be used on battery is drawback.Silver model, I brought. .Delicate, metalic silver keypad no backlight for buttons. cute, delicate buttons.Best for girls, young graceful pretty women like me I would say.I have not played a game, so no comments about.14 inches is fine for my 5 feet body to carry in my hands :)Loved this like anything.. umuuuah :-*Thanks to god for this , This was my 1st big budget shopping on Amazon.Worth it, 3 oct 2021 I brought -sat. Sunday came home.Today did product registeration in MYASUS app.MS office 2019, Mccafe Antivirus also I got in this 1 yr validity, installed in July-Aug 2021 something.It's ok.I have ASUS lapi only that I am still using and this is parent's gift.I have ASUS mobile and big fan since 2014-lifetime.I love ASUS brand like anything. Mindblowing softwares, updates.Ye, you can buy this ! This is my opinion, Go for it :)"
4,"This one is a good budget laptop. Listing out the Pros and Cons after 4 Days of usage.Pros:‚Ä¢ Compact Design with Stylish Look.‚Ä¢ Fast Boot Time (10 Sec) with efficient RAM.‚Ä¢ Future proof with with expandable RAM and Storage Options.‚Ä¢ Pre Installed Windows 10, upgradable to 11.‚Ä¢ Pre Installed MS Office 2019 for Students.‚Ä¢ 256 Gb 'SSD' has considerably fast read and write speed as claimed.‚Ä¢ Decent Battery Juice, works upto 4-5 hours on regular usage.Cons:‚Ä¢ Front Camera is pathetic, definitely can't be used for any type of video calls.‚Ä¢ Screen is not very color accurate, you have to position it properly for good viewing experience.‚Ä¢ Speaker are mediocre, the sound is not upto the notch as per it's price.‚Ä¢ Keyboard click's sound very cheap and it's not even backlit, so it's hard to work in dark.‚Ä¢ 256 Gb Storage is not enough in today's world, you migh have to spend extra to get an internal 1 Tb storage or to get and external HDD if you are keeping large files.‚Ä¢ Doesn't feel so light as claimed."
5,"Excellent laptop.  It comes with Windows 10,  MS Office ,  McAfee antivirus.Screen resolution is superb. Sound Quality is excellent.  We can add External Hard disk (HDD) , if required."
4,"Screen quality is good. Haven't tried it for gaming yet. Will review later.The delivery was quick, packing was great with easy to install instructions. Loving the laptop. More than sufficient for basic personal use/student use."
5,"Light as a feather, bought this for my parents, they use it for general browsing etcPerfect for that type of use and is really easy to carry around, screen quality is also good."
5,If you want a laptop with a casual gaming or If you are a College student then it may be a a write option to you. Love the branding of Asus on middle of back side.
5,good laptop. Windows 11 updated on the first day itself.
5,The product is too good as per price and configuration. Performance so far is very good and very good for education purpose.
3,"Colors are not vibrant , keyboard is small for office usages , one can get  IPS display ,512 Gb  at this price point ~40k"

2,"First of all I would like to tell about the delivery of this product I ordered this laptop in 19th October received 27 th October, look at the duration .I was fedup with this daman delivery it is shame on amazon.noby is expected such a terrific delivery.lenovo budget laptop it's disply is really pathetic viewing angle is so sad. if it is 8 GB ram deffnetly performance will improve amd 3020e chipset  really a power saving chip and there is no heating issue at all.laptop charging speed is amazing, sound is average ,earphone sound quality is good ,Dolby sound equaliser does the job better,,only becoz of this cheap disply no one is going to accept this laptoplaptop,Lenovo could have given IPS HD disply otherwise budget friendly normal usage laptop from lenove"
5,I was happy by this product. I didn't expect this much good. If there was MS office it would  have helped for more users.
5,Niceüëç
1,Its a big cheat. Amazon is delivering refurbished products as a new product. Big cheat. Suggest not to fall into such trap.
4,"Read this review before u purchase this laptop..i will clarify all your queriesU can blindly buy this laptop if the price is below 25.6kFor this price range performance is okay..u may find Avita laptop provide more specs from this..go for Avita ..if u no need of separate nmbr pad and u are okay with windows SWe wont sit on this laptop , we will not keep this laptop under JCB tier ..so build quality is enough for a normal personIf u are looking for laptop under 30k then u buy this product and replace SSD as a primary storage , it will cost around 2.5k or less..now under 30k this will be the best laptopU won't get free Microsoft office inluded in this laptopBattery is good from asus and avitaDisplay is okay..Camera is worst ..don't buy this laptop if camara is ur priority, for online class, Skype call. Other person will not come to know that image is yours. Go for asus its cam better than thisIt has a power button like every laptops but this laptop will turn on when u unfold the laptop..in other laptop first u hv to unfold then u have to press power buttonI recommend this laptop to people who's budget is below 26k and those who need dedicated number pad. And those who want to watch movies .DrawbackNo gamingNot a superfast processor u have to adjust with itNo keyboard light which is very essential actuallyNo Microsoft office subscription included.even u won't get it from any laptops under 26k I bought this laptop for 24.4k so i will recommend people to buy this laptop if u get this below 26k if the price i high then go for asus or avita"
5,"I got it in 20,000 only. Its a wonderful device with sleek design and ultimate performance. Poor camera is only limitation."
1,"This laptop is gross. It is way too slow. Lagging in every simple task-be it opening a pdf or browsing something. Yes, I didn't expect a great device in this budget but at least provide a decent one. 27k is way too much for this garbage. Not expected from Amazon"
2,"Facing issue in ms office.. Its not activated and asking for key,Connected with lenovo support, they kept on 15min hold and them hung up..Need support else well return the product"
2,Very slow processor performance. Even chrome browser won't work property. Avoid purchaseNot even useful for personal/office work
5,"If you are buying this laptop for study use , it is useful to you."
3,"Me bought in September 2020 at 29000 rs, now 6/12/20 27000 .Lost few money .Product is 4 gb ram , best to buy 8 gb ram for fast working the product."
1,I have purchased this Laptop in Nov'2020. At the beginning I could not understand the issues. Its not completely closed (shut down) even after shutdown the laptop. After shut down if I open it even after 1 day its started automatically. At the consequent after 3/4 days its batter charge completely drained out.
5,Nice laptopBut little slowBut worth of buying itGifted to my father he is happy
3,Liked the looks and large screen also sound is quite good however the camera is vga just 3 mp and needs direct light on face to appear good for other person in meetings rest product is ok for basic work and online classes
3,Product is good. Camera is not of good quality. Probably we hv to fix exernal camera.
1,Dislike-PerformanceSoundScreen qualityConnectivityCharging I don't understand why lonovo make this laptop.Like - Only overall look is good.
1,In the product description it is given as Pre loaded windows with life time. But in the laptop windows not working. Whom i need to contact?
1,I presented for educational purpose but its totally waste of the money bcz no more activated softwares and too slow process
5,Thickness n authenticity of the product
1,"Worst product. Don't even think to buy.""Isase tez to kAchhua chalta he""I have purchased 2 laptop and both are too slow and ultimately I have decided to sold out."
1,Very bad product processer is very slow and battery drain quick.lenovo clam 9.5 battery backup.in my use battery backup is 2 hours only.so please don't buy this product.
5,"Best entry level laptop for browsing, checking mail. Good battery backup, lasts for 3 hours. Got it at 21000/- in exchange"
4,"Good, Slim and good battery back up"
3,"I won't tell all good things which YouTube channels are promoting. Good part is overall laptop is good. I will rate 3.5 star out of 5.Now why 3.5 stars:1. The edges to open lid with single hand are super sharp one can get easily scratched.2. Super con - no grip. Seriously MI forgot to put grip below laptop. It doesn't stick to the table and slide like seesaw.3. Speakers are poor4. No camera shutter for privacy and yes camera is of poor quality doesn't even feel like 720p5. Thermal go high on and above keyboard area while charging6. Type C charge provide is of super cheap quality - utter cost cutting. Definately one need to spend 2k just after a year or so because its not going to last long7. No idea about after sale service8. 16:10 is just gimmick - ran Sheehan on amazon prime the video filled 50% portion of the screen and rest was blackAfter using it for few days I feel this laptop 16GB+I5 is bit highly priced. It should be somewhere between 50-55k not more than that. Come on MI you are not a well established brand in laptop world like hp or dell, you should have atleast provided an aggressive pricing.So to conclude it finally, if you can live with above cons go ahead and buy it. It will serve your purpose for next 4-5yrs"
1,"I bought this laptop on 31st AUG. Received before promised time from Amazon. I used the machine for few days , everything looks good. Suddenly last week i found that one of key ( bracket character next to P) is not working. I called Amazon, they said you should contact MI since 10 days period is over (WOW...). I called MI Support they asked me to raise Token. I raised ticket and after that I am just following up from 5-6 days. They keeps saying, part is not available. I requested them to replace since it is just 15 days , but not response. Still I am waiting for their response. MI should think to upgrade their service they made good machine but it is useless if you cann't support even for manufacturing defects. AMAZON, I have been using your platform from last 5-6 years. I use buy almost everything that i need from Amazon but this time I am upset, Why do you tieup with such companies who doesn't have proper Support System for such high value items. You should re-think for 10 days replacement policy for High Value Items on your platform otherwise you will loose trust of your customers."
1,The laptop is good but beware that MI will not support Brand Extended Warranty.
1,Amazon not returning the product inwant a refund for tha same
4,"Mi notebook pro i5 8GB got for Rs 54000 with HDFC offer.Initial impression:Design: 8/10.First impression wow.Unibody aluminium construction with  premium build and design. looks like apple macbook.Small size.Ports: 9/10.Thunderbolt 4, USB A, HDMI ,USB C charging (0 to 100% charging took around 30 minutes) (battery life not tested yet)Display:9/10 16:10 QHD+ display looks very good. Viewing angles are good.Sound: 7/10sound quality is OK, but loudness is somewhat low.Keyboard: 7/103 stage backlit keyboard. Keys are soft. No number pad. Precision touchpad is wide enough.Performance:9/10  Decent performance from Intel i5 11th generation H seriesOverall:8.5/10 It looks like macbook. Good display for watching videos. Adequate performance for coding and office work. It's a good buy."
1,"1. Hi friends it's genuine review I am using the laptop past 2 day except battery life all are good especially display and performance extraordinary, as per the mi guide lines battery life given as 11 hr but I noticed it's 6 hr only.2. I noticed screw sound in side the laptop, I reach out to Amazon 2mro mi team will come and check my laptop."
5,I am fully satisfied with the purchase. Feeling like really a pro while using the lap. Best choice in this price go with the 16gb ram.
1,I purchased it on the first sale. I have kept it on changing now and it is giving me heavy electric shocks.
5,"Pros - lovely display, fast fingerprint reader, Ms  Office  PREINSTTALLED , Slim and light  weight,  Looks very lovely etc. It means almost  everything is good at this range.Cons - slight heating after hour's of work"
5,"Hi Guys, From the user experience, It has excellent build quality, Light weight, Finger print sensor is very quick, Backlit keyboard is awesome, Extremely superb. I brought i5 16gb variant for programming. Its a perfect windows macbook edition."
5,"CONS: Low sound from speakers, but i mostly use earphones so that‚Äôs not a problem for me.PROS :After Apple, it has the best track pad.It‚Äôs finger print sensor beats Apple as well.720MP camera is far more decent that HP‚Äôs HD camera.Love the chiclet keyboard and backlit feature has been a big fulfilling need.Battery backup is the best thing i feel in this.I used multiple tabs for browsing and played online training videos for avg of 4 hours daily. Once when charged in the morning, i leave it on & connected to wifi throughout the day and it still shows 1 hours of more charge at the end of the day."
1,"For 6 days it was okay and then it gave me electric shock 3 times today. I'm very scared, disappointed and worried. And now I'm not getting connected to customer service. Don't buy. Extremely disappointed!!"
5,"Just got this laptop today, so based on just a few hours of usage.Earlier using Lenovo Yoga 510 with touch and 360 degree rotation, but I havnt used these features much.Needed a sturdy laptop, with latest specs, great display and for personal use, and as a backup if my office laptop dies on suddenly, but main purpose was entertainment, personal document work, photo editing as I am a photography enthusiast. Display was very important for me.(Update 17/9/21: There are ways to calibrate the display, built in the laptop itself, to some extent and this is awesome. I was able to tweak the display fairly close to printing colors, all ok now)-----This department still I feel a bit short on my expectation, as it has 100% sRGB and 2k resolution. Sure its crisp and bright and way better then any mainstream laptop display, but colors are not accurate(100% sRGB means it can display all the colors in that space, but it doesn't claim or deliver accurate display). There is a lot of difference between pics edited on this computer and the prints I take on my sRGB space printer, even more so than my previous 5 year old lenovo with Full HD IPS display. I would test this out more and update. So not a replacement of a proper color accurate display. On the other hand, colors do not feel as punchy for watching movies etc, but not a big deal for me. Display for any other task is good enough, very sharp and much brighter than other laptops in the market. I am not disappointed, but not impressed based on what my usage is.Please bear in mind this is a special requirement, 99.99% people would be amazed with the display quality, as this was amazing for day to day usage. Just not for critical work, and for the price I dont think anything comes close.(see update above)As far as other things go, performance, boot times, finger print, typing on keyboard, look and feel are all great. Seems sturdy, so should be good for a long time. This laptop is also not for gamers, as I feel performance for very heavy games and other tasks a little short, people need for video editing should spend some more for the i7 version or better assemble a desktop if mobility is not absolutely a necessity. Mine is i5 16gb which is good enough for me. Battery life is good for 8 hours of light work.Overall, for the price, and considering all metal build and performance it offers, this is a great buy. Just see your use case, take sometime to review your own requirements, and then consider. As a day to day laptop, I dont see anyone would find any shortcoming with this laptop. Its fine in all the departments."
5,"All the pros just one cons 'the speaker'.No other brands are providing such value for money ultrabook.Plz Buy 16gb ram as it is non-upgradable.Buy mi notebook pro (14inches) if your primary requirment is for work/school/college.Otherwise Buy mi notebook ultra (15.6inches).(If you wanna spend 60k and you are confused to choose between mi notebook pro 16gb or mi notebook ultra 8gb, just go for 16gb..... But you can also choose mi notebook ultra 16gb by paying 64k."
5,"This is an excellent laptop for 52k (after discounts). Writing this review so you can set your expectations right.Here is what you need to watch out:============================1) Sub par volume levels from the built-in speakers. It's ok for video conferencing. But if you want to enjoy movies etc, be prepared to use heaphones or external speakers.2) Keyboard can be better. Feedback and feel from key presses could have been better. (I am a Macbook and Thinkpad user. So my experience is relative to those keypads. If you have not previously used Macbook or Thinkpads, you may not even notice any thing odd with Xiaomi's keypad).3) Track pad can be better (Again my experience is relative to Macbooks and Thinkpads). Some times it failed to register clicks/taps. Need to wait for update to see if it's a driver issue or hardware issue.4) RAM can not be upgraded. But storage can be upgraded. 8 GB RAM will be enough for most of day to day work like web browsing with multiple windows, using Word, Excel etc, doing video conferencing or other regular activities simultaneously. Go for 16 GB RAM if you really intend to use fat applications like 4K video editing etc on daily basis. For Rs.3,000 more I would have certainly purchased the 16GB model had it been in stock. But I am OK with 8 GB for the our intended use.5) The SSD is partitioned into 140GB and 371GB (or so). REMEMBER TO CLUB THE TWO PRATITIONS. Otherwise, you will end up destroying the SSD in 2 or 3 years. SSD has max write limitations. Rewriting into the 140 GB system partition over and over will very quickly destroy this partition and thereby renders the SSD useless. Make sure to use the entire 512 GB as one single partition for extended life of SSD.6) No documentation from Xiaomi on this laptop. All other established manufacturers like HP/Dell/Lenovo etc have a plethora of documentation provided in their official websites. But with Xiaomi, there is little to no documentation with this product.7) Charge this laptop only from outlets which are properly grounded. Also, don't use third party 2 prong chargers. There seems to be some deficiencies in this laptop in regards to power supply management. You may end up frying your laptop in the long run if you are not careful about how you charge this laptop. (It may be an issue with charger. Will update after trying with Lenovo charger)Here is what is best with this product:==============================1) Excellent display. Can work on it full day with out stressing your eyes. This is the most compelling reason for me to pick this laptop. We can stay focused when our eyes are not strained. The text is super smooth and crystal clear to read which is what distinguishes this laptop from others in the segment.2) Two Type C Thunderbolt/USB 3.2 ports. Both can be used for charging with the supplied 65W charger. Also, its simple to connect to an external monitor or TV. There is a regular size HDMI port as well.3) PD charging support. Can use any other modern day Type C charging (which support PD charging).4) Finger print scanner worked flawless.5) Clean and uncluttered look and feel. Light weight and right form factor. Easy to travel with. The aluminium build quality is sturdy and is better than my expectations from a Rs.52,000 laptop. Very confident that this will last long without losing appeal.6) NVMe SSD is a big plus. In addition, with Thunderbolt port, using an external SSD would make it seamless and gives an instant access.7) Windows 10 and MS-Office activation was straight forward and worked without a glitch."
1,"Bought the i7 16 GB variant which was delivered today itself. Device hangs randomly. And now has completely conked off and is refusing to start. Despite the faulty product  being delivered today itself, no help for replacement from Amazon. God save those who go in for this."
4,"Today I got my product delivered and I m very happy to use it it has very good battery backup, premium look only thing missing was a good quality speaker"
5,"Great laptop, great battery, display and processor all are performing awesome. 16 gb ram is more than enough, just go for it. Value for money."
5,"I have purchased mi notebook pro for normal student use (non gaming) and this was best deal at this price point -57500 using hdfc discounts (16Gb ram, 512 SSD, Intel i5 11th Gen)I have been using it for 2 days and this review is based on that.Look and feel - Premium because of its metal body, it is robust, colour is so classyI am switching from 15inch to 14 inch, so yes it is small and that's the best part for me, because it makes it comfortable to work with with such a good display and small bezels.Camera is goodAudio is also surprisingly good for me as in most of the reviews on YouTube were giving bad reviews about the loudness (maybe mi has fixed some drivers )It is fast, boottime is just around 2-3 seconds and fingerprint sensor and trackpad works like a charmYou should go for it if you want the best at this price (however many of you may be skeptical about the after service, I thought that anyway nothing happens to a laptop for one year warranty period  and after that we can get it repair at a local shop even if mi don't provide much support so why to worry about it)Hope it help you"
5,"Prices of this Mi laptop and all other models are immensely competitive. No other brands can achieve this cost with these specifications. I am using windows for long and quite compatible with this OS. Therefore wanted to go for windows supporting laptop. This one caught my eye and didn't disappoint because of:Good battery lifeLight weight and compactMetallic bodyGreat screen resolution and displayGreat screen brightnessBacklit keyboardWindows 10It would've been better had windows provided office too. But even without it, this laptop is one of the best according to its cost and available specifications."
5,"... if you are looking for a non-touch screen, non-heavy-gaming, Intel cpu, compact laptop. If fine with AMD cpu, there can be alternative, but otherwise, really no. So far, behaved all exactly a Windows Laptop should do, no complaints. Build quality is better than my third office laptops of twice the price. Only missing thing (other than no touch screen) is IR camera, so face unlock does not work. Rest all, including properly smoothen metal edges, proper rubber grip at the bottm, proper quality USB C charger and cable, bright vibrant screen with proper high resolution, all 4 sides thin bazels, one time office 2019 license (not that 365 which will make you pay every year) all good and as expected."
2,"At first everything was good.Laptop was goodBuilt - premium 5/5Screen - Premium 5/5 But the issues starts afterwardsOn the second day after my purchase I start seeingThat screen of my laptop goes dark or complete blank for 2-3 second more like it blinks for 2-3 seconds and I thought it was a system glitch so I ignored it. I barely used my laptop for 2 hours thorought the whole day.But on the third day 11 December I was watching a movie and again it start happening but this time it start happening frequently like after every 10 min.And duration of the black flashing or blinking sums upto 5-6 sec.I checked everything. Drivers was up-to-date, everything was up to date. It was not an software issue. Maybe some wire or cable which is connected to the screen is damaged and is getting worse if I continue to use it because the screen blacking out time and how often it goes black is increasing.I am devastated right now.So I make a replacement call. Mr. Rahman  was on the other end of the call and he get me a replacement unit but the catch was I have to wait for almost month to get it replaced because they are now out of stock he said.Laptop is goodThat built that feel everything but screen going black is not normal.I am wondering that how may people are affected by the same issue just like me.ü§ßü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
4,"I'm using i7 16GB variant. I love the display, keyboard. I can turn on and login into windows within 10s. I bought this only for coding so I haven't played any games. Not yet.For those who are looking for thin, modernish, light weight laptop go for this machine. It is powerful enough to handle Android Studio. Don't go for 8GB, because after opening few chrome tabs and code editors my RAM was like 8GB occupied. So definitely go for 16GB model if you do multiprocessing.They claimed we can get 11hrs out of the battery but honestly the maximum I got is 6.5hrs when coding in simple editors like VS Code.The speaker is horrible. I cannot listen to anything. I always have to use earphones. That's the biggest cons. Everything else is great about this laptop.The device is eligible to run Windows 11. I haven't tried the beta because I read the windows explorer is still slow in beta and Android Subsystem for Windows is yet to arrive on Windows 11."
1,Keep crashing and rebooting. Return window is just 7 days not good. And MI support is slow. I will update once MI fixes the issue.
3,"check the detail description, the CPU speed is just 1.2 GHz, it is a very slow laptop.It does not matter how much RAM and Hard disk of your laptop, until CPU frequency is not good, no use of them.I hope it is useful for you before buying it."
1,"The laptop is not working properly. The issues are the following:1. Caps key does not work2. Very slow trackpad/ cursor3. Automatically restarts even if I don't press the start buttonWhen I called customer care for refund, they didn't address the issue and kept me on a loop. Worst customer experience."
4,"This laptop is indeed stylish, slim and good looking with an average battery life and satisfying performance for normal usage like online lectures and so on...The display is too good but not completely anti glare. Fingerprint sensor not present and the camera is a disgrace.Overall this laptop is quite okay and it deserves a 3.5 rating.*edit: Great metallic texture andsmooth body and attractive silver color!"
1,"This is an awful product, please don‚Äôt buy fullaa waste of money. Don‚Äôt expect such a low quality product from Lenevo. I bought this for my nephew, and now regret it. Amazon customer service is very bad, didn‚Äôt expect this from Amazon. Battery life is less than 2 hours , camera is also a big let down.  Doesn‚Äôt come with ms office too. Dont recommend this , please go for similar product from other brand."
5,"After so many research on internet I brought this laptop finally. It's a full a great with in 35k of budget. You can't get 8 gb ram laptop with i3 10th gen in this budget it's jst came in new stock last week. It's also has full hd anti glare display with 15.6 inch screen almost 70% screen to body ratio. All best in class with this budget. Only one cons I got, there is no lan port. It's 2020 after all, we all have wifi I hope it's not a big cons you can ignore it."
5,"A Budget Laptop. Overall it's an awesome product from Lenovo.I'll recommend this one, for basic work purpose."
3,"Over all good performance for basic use for business online class watching movies best in the model speed process is better in midd range one of the best model in the price for basic & normal uses iam so happy for business work &, for students & for enjoyment for watching movies & songs  for mid range laptop for business & basic use"
4,Boots up in 1 min. Speed is OK. Office 365 not given for subscription. initial setup quick. no type c. slim and good
1,"// BEWARE OF CHEAP TRICKS ON AMAZON //As per images the laptop external exposure is plastic body, when asked Amazon about it they are saying the description says its platinum grey colour not body. The product is non returnable only applicable for replacement in 7 days in case of defective piece received.Product is not slim only one inch at the borders is curved slim. product may be useful as per configuration but mark downs by the physical appearance.Product axis in in plastic made hence you can imagine how long the product may lasti dont like the product its not upto mark and want to return but Amazon cant make this possible"
4,"Don't expect to do any gaming besides card games. But if you're using it for productivity purposes like MS Office, OpenOffice etc, this is all you need. Don't buy this if you're doing heavy video editing or graphics-heavy work. Battery capacity is disappointing especially these days when most laptops can do a minimum of 6 hours. You'll be lucky to get 4 hours of backup time on this one. Maybe a little more if you reduce the brightness of the screen. Overall it is a decent machine for the price."
5,"This should be the best deal I would have got at this price range. My need is connection to office network, internet surfing and basic domestic operations. The laptop is a perfect choice.It is extensively light weight. Even lighter than my other 14 inch laptop.Glad to have purchased it since over a month already."
5,"Up until now, things are looking fine ! But Best budget Laptop ! that's for sure , and also smooth performance ! best for students"
1,"My 5 years old daughter is using for her online classes, but its battery does last for 2 hours. It drained within 1 hours 30 mins.Also, Camera quality is very poor, REALLY.Charger wire length is very short as compare to other laptop (Dell, HP, etc)"
1,"Absolute trash. And the service is worse. Bought this in urgency for the kid‚Äôs exams. It stopped working in one week! It‚Äôs been more than two weeks now that it has been with the service Center and apparently the mother board has had to be replaced, the key board is replaced and the hinge joining the screen is to be replaced. What the the hell did Lenovo sell me? A piece of trash?? And the service Center people don‚Äôt respond, don‚Äôt pick calls, have no clue as to what is happening or when we can expect it back. An absolute waste of my money"
4,After using one month system are hang
3,"Low camera quality, very heavy difficult for kids to use, very very bad battery life. MS office pack is not included will have to buy separately, if you buy form SM official website they charge 3500 approx for ONE YEAR. Dont buy this laptop.Advise: Buy from shops near to after phycilally verifying the laptop as per your needs."
4,Look wise a beautiful metal body. Screen display is beautiful and watched few 4k videos and results are awesome. Comes with windows 10 but doesn't have ms office. In this drive we can expect that. Battery backup is not so great.Overall a beautiful and good laptop in this price range which work flawless for moderate work.
5,"Brought this Laptop at 34,999/- Which is a Great Deal !! Best Laptop for Office Purpose with 8 GB (DDR4) Ram!!Must Go For It !!!!"
4,Value for money.  Good to have separate buttons for PgUP down etc.  They are on the Num Pad. Numpad as such wasn't necessary in my view.Doesn't have the keyboard light. That would be desirable.
1,"Product is absolute waste of money, its very slow, screen clarity is poor, webcam is of no use as it doesn‚Äôt have any clarity at all.Just been 7-8 months and computer already stopped working.Expected a bit more better product from Lenovo.Please don‚Äôt get deceived with the specification they have quoted, real life performance is very poor and too slow."
1,"This laptop has the worse problems ever. Shuts down anytime, camera is not working sometimes, the processor is slower than a snail.Battery life is worse than a 2G micromax phone.Hangs like anything.Please don't buy this."
1,The dealer didn't give any warranty card with it. There seems to be some problems with the drivers. Or many drivers are not installed properly. Overall a very shabby work. I will not recommend this dealer to anyone.
3,Sad camera.. this is worst than a 1000 RS mobile..
1,"Don't waste money in this laptop. Pls check the detail before purchase this. There is no CD ROM , no lan connector slot and no PC connector slot.It's having 8GB RAM ,but if you open one or two applications it got hanged & its shows 100% disk utilisation.Also webcam camera quality is bad."
1,The performance is much slower looking at the configuration. Keyboard started malfunctioning in a year and it stopped booting after a year. Waste of money.
1,Product not working properly yesterday only open the box pls change
4,Everything is ok and worth but while switch it on it performs quite slow also bottom bezel finishing is not up to the mark.Battery runs up to 3 hours.Overall it's still best in the market.Worth buying.Lookwise it's pretty enough.Slim fit look.Choice is yours .Budget laptop under 35k
1,"Dont buy, waste. When I buy this it is very well fast, after one month it became slow and batter life is 1h 30min . After some month it become very slow, it is take 10 - 15 to start."
4,"Its thin nice screen but speed is ok not much, comparing 8 gb ram speed not that much battery life telling 5 hours but only 3 to 3.5 hours. Overall ok for this price"
1,Damage product received
2,When I connected the charge it's displaying connected but not charging
1,We bought this laptop one month before and now facing problems as shown in the picture...while using the system immediately the message will come like this. This is happening every day.
4,"Everything is fine but I didn't check LAN port before purchase after that I'm shocked there is no LAN port,in my opinion it's not good idea to remove LAN port"
5,"Satisfacted,Nice product, Genuine product,like the look and features however there are few cons,Battery life not great approx 3-4 hours for internet users."
3,"I wish the laptop was send with a good bag along with it, so that one would have such accessories befitting the item purchased."
4,"Budget friendly laptop, after a detail research I found this laptop best in class. 8GB RAM makes it too fast to do your daily task. I'm using it for my office purpose. worthy every single penny."
5,Super Lenovo Model and Amazon is always best
1,I am totally Unsatisfied with Lenevo Laptop. It Dischargeing very soon. Pls arrange Check & Replace.
4,"First I appreciate the delivery by Amazon as promised timeline even during this covid situation.Below is my Lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3 config,AMD Ryzen 5 4600h, 512 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram, 120HZ, Nvidia GTX 1650.Model.no: 82EY00UAIN1. Full HD display is really good at this price.2. Build quality is good and the structure is simply the best.3. Keypad, trackpad and backlight are very nice.4. The laptop boots up with in 5 sec, it's awesome.Everything is perfect except the below 2 items,1. Battery is draining little faster for normal usuage itself.2. Audio speaker is not as good as  expected.In a nutshell I would say this is a very good budget gaming laptop if you are looking around 60k."
3,"Yes, you read the headline right. If any of that is not your priority, you may go ahead with the laptop. It's a good laptop, don't get me wrong, but1. if you're expecting the advertised battery performance, then you will be disappointed - immensely. I get at most an hour, which to my requirement is good enough. I always look for power source nearby, and if there is none, I try to limit my electronic (phone, laptops etc) usage. It's all right with me, but maybe not with you.2. if you're expecting a ""premium"" support, as advertised, then you will be disappointed again. Exactly the day AFTER my return window with Amazon ended, I found out that the number 5 on the right-side number pad gets stuck. ONE day! A conglomerate like Amazon should be in a place to make exceptions, but it's all right, I was still within Lenovo's warranty,  and because of that, I was asked by the Amazon representative to contact them - and I did. By bad support, I am not talking about the support I got from Amazon - this guy was just following standard protocol - it's Lenovo's! The same day, I raised a ticket with them, and it's been a week now, and I haven't gotten ANY call/email/message from them. Now I hear you ask, ""But doood. If you haven't gotten any email or message, the complaint wouldn't have gone through or registered"", to which I say, I see the ticket number when I go to the Lenovo portal, and it's in ""Investigating"" status (or something like that). You get the point. ONE WEEK of premium support (or lack thereof)!**UPDATE** - Lenovo finally acknowledged the request and some 8 - 9 tos-and-fros later, agreed to send a technician, who found out the issue is real and agreed for a replacement (Obviously it wasn't all this simple - this whole process took him about 2 hours). FYI, as on this writing, the replacement is yet to arrive (and the laptop is sealed in a Lenovo branded cover with its carton box - post Covid-19 procedure I suppose - and is in my custody). And that's 2 days without laptop- Just saying :/**LATEST UPDATE** - Sorry I couldn't update the progress sooner. The laptop was finally collected from my residence a few days later, and Amazon issued a full refund. I had purchased this laptop by exchanging my older one, and the amount for that was given to me as Amazon Pay, which was ‚Çπ4500. I went on to buy another laptop (not the same one though), and I have to say, I miss this laptop. If it weren't for the issue with the keyboard, I'd be a proud owner of this laptop.3. if you expect to play a lot of newer games - I haven't tried this personally, and I bought this laptop not (entirely) for gaming (although I had installed CoD Ghosts (I know it's an old game), and after like an hour into the game, it glitched on me once - at a place when there was a huge explosion, maybe the graphics card couldn't process that much info) but I must say it's been a good performer. I ran my DL (deep learning) model with over 1 crore rows, and about 17 columns and it performed better than my work laptop, which has (only) a 16 gb RAM, no external graphic card. I will upgrade the RAM on this to 16 (it's 8*1 now and I will add another equivalent 8 (3200/CL-22)) and see how it goes, but all that after I get the issue at hand sorted out.BTW, the reason I realized my keyboard had an issue late was because I use a Bluetooth keyboard and the only time I used its own keyboard was in its first day, and somehow I forgot to test the keyboard.FYI, it's a fingerprint magnet."
5,"Lenovo ideapad gaming 3 120Hz- I used this about 10 days. I am sharing my 10 days experiance with this system.1.BULID QUALITY: Screen side body is bulid by somekind of Fiber which is very stiff and the lower body is bulid by plastic but it feels like a premium. Laptop design is ultimate.For Bulid quality and design it can get 5/5 definitly.2. CAMERA: One grate thing about camera is they give Privacy shutter feature through which u can lock your camera. A good camera security feature.Camera quality is not good.It's worst. It gives too much pixalated images.You can record video upto 720p 30fps. It is better to purchase external camera if you are a creator/Live streamer.3. KEYBOARD: It is full size keyboard. Key design and the quality is awesome. This keyboard design wil helps to comfort and accurate typing. Key movement is also good. It has two modes of backlight(BLUE color). The blue colored key light feels like premium. One important thing is, You should always take care(clean) of keybord, Any dust and stones kind of small particles will easely enter below the keys and may cause problems when typing. Always clean keyboard before using it.4. BATTERY: Battery life is decent. For me It gives almost 6hrs to 6.5hrs in 'bettter performance' mode where I done coding and MS word kind of things which doesn't need much CPU power.5. DISPLAY: 15.6"" 120Hz Full HD IPS anti-glare display gives Very smooth video experiance. Plays 4k videos well. Viewing angle is also good.6.AUDIO QUALITY: It comes with Dolby Atmos Stereo speaker. Sound is loud and clear(i don't felt any kind of noise from the speakers). It is more than enough.7. STORAGE: It comes with 512GB SSD.There is a dedicated HDD slot,We can insert 1 TB of HDD along with this 512GB SSD there.8. PERFORMANCE: I have not tested any game,it may works fine. Gives awesome performance for office work and multitasking. If video editing concerned, Try to buy 16GB RAM varient or upgrade this system to 16GB, So that you can get better performance(working fine in 8GB also).CONCLUSION: Under 60-63k,It's realy worth and value for money.Best video and audio experiance, grate performance."
4,"I played watch dogs 2 with high settings @75-90fps (with temporal filtering on), without it 50-61fps @ high. Ultra 28-42fps without temporal filtering onbattlefield 1 @ultra 70-90 fpsForza Horizon 4 @ custom (high-ultra) 78-120state of mind @epic 61 fpsI think these results are decent as it is not a high end GPU.Pros:*The GPU  temperature never reached more than 66¬∞C Even after 2hrs of gaming . So Thermals are Osm. CPU reached nearly 80¬∞C when stress testing but during gaming around 72-75¬∞C. *During working hours the laptop remains silent you won't notice any sound if set to quiet mode. (#peace :) )*What I love about lenovo is their keyboard if ur into coding or some kind of typing stuff u'll be very much satisfied.*Speakers of laptop is loud enough and audio software Nahimic is cooler than Hp's B&O, it tunes audio depends on ur use which is a cool feature.*The Laptop has 135Watt Charger which can bring smile on Overclockers face as it can squeeze extra juice in games and Video-editing. CPU {45Watt}+GPU{50Watt} which makes use of overall usage of 120  watts(rough estimation) including motherboard other components like speakers, display, etc. 15watt which is left can used to squeeze for extra performance of CPU  and  GPU (most Manufactures restricts chargers to 90Watt or 120 watt)*Lenovo vantage provides conservative mode which increases battery lifespan. most laptops OEM don't provide this feature.Cons:*The laptop doesn't have an option to set its refresh rate to 60Hz in settings by default it runs at 120HZ which can be an issue with battery drain as it has low capacity battery. I think it will be fixed with BIOS Update in future.*They could have done better with Battery instead of 45WHr.*Could have Given an extra usb port (as 2 usb port restricts ur workspace to limited options)*From gaming point of view they could have given mux switch which boosts fps (iGPU bottlenecks DGPU) .*Sweaty-wet hands can make laptop dirty with marks, its with build quality. But not a big problem u can avoid it by cleaning time to time.I had an issue while watching movies or youtube as the battery is draining to quickly but I got it fixed by switching to iGPU for VLC and Browsers . it saved alot of battery.""""""Best about the laptop:One of the main advantage of this laptop out of  all other laptops is that the laptop charger-socket has an unique rectangle pin which helps in longetivity of female of socket. Believe me I used round pin  laptop charger and they are the worst. After, an year of use female socket will be loosened {""""""as it gets loosened it doesn't connect to pin properly which creates a power barrier between laptop and charger. By not getting enough power required and the power barrier directly results in performance_drop by running CPU and GPU at lower clock speeds """"""} and u need to get a replacement for it, which costs around 2K-3k and u should have to open the laptop which can be a riskier job as its not same as adding ram. which is an absolute terrible experience u can have and also ""You cannot claim warranty for female socket as it gets counted for improper usage.""_""""""Overall laptop is decent for working and mid level gaming."
5,At this price range performance is very good with 120hz panel..
3,"Value For Money ü§ë under 60k Budget Gaming LaptopsAfter two days of buying the laptop, my laptop was hanging, when I pressed the power key, the problem was fixed, after that no problem appeared.Not so good for content creator as it has 3GHz to 4GHz clock speed.Thermal: charging site is hot, but other sites are cold.The battery life lasts for 1.5 to 2 hours while playing gaming. Best Gaming Experience.Battery life up to 5 hours for normal multitasking.camera is nothing special.Display is good. Keyboard is very good.  The designs give a slightly premium look."
5,"Still not used that much. I love the keyboard layout and key spacing, display is ok for development and gaming.Loudspeaker sound quality and voice clarity for skype calls is ok. By default almost 40 - 50% of RAM is used, bu i didn't affect the performance. Better to go with additional 8 GB for gaming"
5,Well I was using an old laptop it was sooo slowwwww.It hardly give 30 fps in cs go at low settings but this laptop can easily give you around 116 to 180 fps in the gameplayAnd all others AAA title games works great.Well no laptop have great colour accuracySo for games I use my lg bx oled tv.Well this GTX 1650 can do games in 1080 p ultra  with avg fps of 120 and 1440 p at ultra with avg fps for 80.This can change for some graphics demanding to anes but I can sure you you can play all those games at 1080 p at 60 fps. Well the GTX series GPU doesn't have rt core soo it can't support ray tracing but it doesn't matter if you are planning to play games on the laptop screen.If you are planning to play games on your 4k TV then one can buy ps 5.Anyway if you are planning to use this for  your primary gaming then go for the laptop have RTX series GPU or you can buy ps 5 just like I am going to do for gaming purpose.
1,"Works just like a laptop without a GPU or I should say it's worst than it. Blender crashes everytime I render a very simple image without any texture.Charge lasts for an hour max. If you are working, you should always have the charger plugged in.The Sound is feeble. This one is not for listening to music or watching movies.It's a useless laptop for the price. I doubt the specs mentioned in the description are actually part of this model.If you are looking for a laptop for creative purpose or any other general use, please avoid this one. Don't go by the positive reviews."
5,"I got the 56k festive season deal for this product. Being a heavy user, I have tested this out extensively and so far it has performed according to the expectations. It's a 1650, so can't expect to run the new AAA games at Ultra, but most of the times games run perfectly on High, which is good enough. The battery life is better I had expected of a laptop of this caliber, lasts upto 5 hours with proper settings. The 120Hz screen is a blessing for FPS games, and even Windows 11 utilizes it. Applications run smooth, there is expandable storage for both Storage and RAM. The body is sturdy, the screen can be lifted with just a finger. The keyboard backlight is always welcome."
2,Laptop get heat up  quickly  while playing game and air vent design  not good as display get heated  bzc of air vent heat
5,Video Player is loading.
1,"This is just like other cheap products. The picture I have shared is of ""Assassin's creed origins"" at ""very low"" graphics quality. I have touched no other settings for graphics in the system. This system meets recommended system requirements and still look at the performance.There are several games like Mortal Shell and Dark souls 3 that had same issues like this. ""Destiny 2"" was running at 2 fps and failed to even start.Please spend your money on some other better product, not on a garbage like this."
4,"Outer box is little damaged but thank god inner package and box isn't got harmed. I ordered it with mouse and got it at ‚Çπ55,389 as I am getting the highest discount on this combo.I expected the power cord will be atleast 1.5 m but it was just 0.5m but charging cable comes with good length.First I would like to mention some cons that I feel to shareLaptop lid attract fingerprintAlready got a scratch due to plastic buildBattery does last long as it is a gaming laptop"
1,"I regret taking this Laptop, within 3 months my Laptop's motherboard got dead and Nothing was working.Had to replace the motherboard and even after that the whole performance has degraded. There no help from premium care they are just saying sorry sorry but not providing a rigid solution. My whole 65k have been wasted. Worst laptop worst service. Don't buy!"
4,"Ryzen 5 4600h with gtx1650 under 62k is great. Keyboard looks nice with blue backlit.Haven't tried any AAA games but played some low end games, no issues there.There is a little bit of heating at the bottom panel of screen, because of the vent provided, not too much to be worried about. Battery backup is average while gaming (lasts upto 50-70 min). On normal usage can last upto 3-3.5 hrs.nvme ssd is really fast, system boots up within 6 sec. Overall a good laptop considering the price segment and is worth buying."
5,This is the best budget laptop under 60k. Battery backup is as same as the all gaming laptops. It can perform all the tasks very easily. Typing experience is soo good better than other brands. Colour accuracy is average. Best laptop in this budget. Just go for it.
5,"-For student it will be really help .-its for casual gamers and and student who are in engineering and Designing .-U can easily use software like Autocad , inventor , ANSYS ,CREO etc .-Don't worry about the Screen quality ,If you are new laptop user or you from middle class family  its just go for it.- Lenovo is trusted brand i use Lenovo all in one pc from last 6 year and still."
5,For gaming it's awesome. 50-60 fps for Valhalla have not tried other games yet but it's so smooth. Display is 120hz and it look so good. Battery life is 1-2 hr for continually gaming and 4-6 hr for normal usage. Loved it‚ù§Ô∏è
5,"Liked the product , performence is Excellent , display is good for beginner buyer or normal and gaming usage , battery is average got 3 1/2 to 4 at quiet mode and in balanced it's 2 1/2 to 3 hour , build quality is good"
4,Bought the product for my work on Machine Learning not for gaming Some of the problems that I am encountering with the product is there is no key for right click and the touchpad does not work properly for right click Have not used the product for the actual works for which it was intended
5,"It is super fast with nice keyboard and look. Sound is good and speed is amazing. Paisa wasool but camera quality is not amazing , just okay ."
4,Really Good LaptopI gave this a 4 star because the battery life isn't that good and I can't lower the refresh rate for better battery
4,My initial impressionsA good Budget friendly laptop..I will post a long term usage review based on how it sustain over a period of time.Right now it works really well.
5,It's like a Bugati in price of Lamborghini.... Awesome really really amazed by it's performance:--FPS:-eFootball 21 :- 100+ constantValorant :- 100+ fps constantTekken 7 :- 60-70 fps
5,Total package of everything you want from gaming to utility this laptop is a good option and satisfies its price .
1,"Overheating issues. while playing minecraft fan sound was loud (you can assume the condition if you want to play games like RDR2, gta V).battery wasn't working. On first day, laptop hanged"
2,WiFi connection issue. Can‚Äôt connect to WiFi. Reinstalled Network Adapter but no use.
5,Best laptop in this range
5,Those who are buying this for programming and gaming go for it .The product is value for money.
4,"The device is great when it comes to built quality, performance, trackpad, etc. I specially love speakers and mainly the keyboard which has good travel and it's just a joy to type on. I also like the Chrome OS which is better than Windows when you are going for budget laptops as they work faster.But the real problem is the display, it's 720p which is good for the price, but it has colour shifting problem like an TN display. The white balance is out of this world and there is no option to change it on the chromebook. So you need to live with it. There are even times I need to bend and watch as I can't even see anything while siting in the normal position. This isn't just my device fault, this model's display is designed like that. So I am really really warning you to check the reviews on the web before buying, mainly about the display."
3,Good for surfing only. No use if you are working on powerpoint and excel sheets .ProsGood batteryGood audio outputDisplay is okConsCamera is avgNo office files editingKeybord is badExcel and powerpoint limited options
4,"Even if this laptop has PlayStore, remember this is not Android based laptop. This is ChromeOS based. So some of the applications may not be available in this. For example, i needed ""Angel broking"" (Angel One) app which is available in Android mobile, but missing in this laptop's Play store. Otherwise it deserves a 5-star rating."
1,"Worst product, don't purchase if you want this for office use. This is a useless product,  more like a tab. I purchased it for my office work and its of no use. And the irony is amazon is not allowing me to return this.If u are purchasing don't,  don't fall into the trap. It's a scam"
5,"This is great laptop for all day to day tasks. I like the performance you get at this configuration. You can do pretty much everything on this. The battery is awesome, you can use it for 7-8 hrs without power. I have got this for my daughter for which she is using for college and study purpose. I am seriously planning to shift to chromebook for my next laptop for all work purpose. Thumb's up."
1,"My humble request is everyone, don't buy this laptop, it's waste of money, not at all useful for daily routine, they are not giving refund or exchange. Think thousand times before buy"
4,Pros:-Screen quality is affordable for this price with intouch screenBattery life is perfectBrightness is goodSound quality is clearCamera must be improved but in this segment it is ok..Keyboard are user friendly for usageTouchpad is goodCons:-Cam quality can be increasedInternal storage 64gb is not enough
4,Its been 2days since the purchase. It has Super clarity vedios but audio is not upto the mark (unless you are using headset)It hanged a little bit in the 2nd day itself (maybe because i was using it for long hours) otherwise its a best choice for study purpose & light use.
2,"Bought this laptop for general use (browsing and office document editing). The hardware is very bad with the touchpad not responding on the right hand side. The keyboard is also not responsive and feels cheaper than other laptops in the same price range.Unfortunately, I couldn't return the product as the one-week return window expired."
4,"Laptop is sleek and fast. It is lightweight and thin.Super performance.Only draw back is as it is an android OS you will find it difficult to use word, excel, power point as you have to use online version of this application"
5,Currently for my work i am using i7 8th gen with 8gb ram that one take 1min around. This hp one boots in 4-5 seconds. Using from 5days so i don't have comprehensive review.
2,One of the worst laptops I have ever used. I seriously doubt it why they call it a laptop. Its total waste.
5,Product returned

1,Take too much time to turn on.. From day one it is not working. There was no pickup return.
1,"Nothing is supporting, It is good for nothing,"
5,"Good product, best for my daily office work. But you need to buy MS office seperately."

5,"I bought this laptop at 70k. I'm not gamer, bought this mainly for Machine Learning, Video processing and for GPU intensive programming. It's nice to have NVIDIA GPU laptop, so that you can train (fine tune), visualize inference in real time.I installed Ubuntu right away. There is no support from Lenovo to its Vantage software on Linux Platform. If you want fine grained controlled over GPU, keep the Windows too in separate partition to change the settings. The ""Fn+Q"" works fine in Linux, so you don't have to keep it, It's optional. There is good Driver support from NVIDIA on Linux Platform.""1. Display""  I would say it's perfect, if you are switching from 60Hz, you will love it.  Color accuracy is perfect for programming.""2.  Keyboard""  It's really amazing to type.  It might feel slightly compact, but it depends on person to person.  It's dimension is (23cmx10cm) .  Go check first in Lenovo Store.""3. Battery Life""  That's the major drawback in this laptop. It only last 3.5 hours even in normal use in 30% brightness.""4. TouchPad & Mouse""  TouchPad is really smooth. You don't feel need for separate Mouse. But There is no Separate Left and  Right Primary Button. So you might have to buy Mouse based on your requirement.""5. Speaker""  It's Perfect. HARMAN Speaker, just go for it."
3,Battery sucks.
5,This laptop is good for gaming and there is no lag while playing the games. Brightness is also good.
4,Nice laptop
5,A MINIMALIST BEAST
4,Great product
2,"All please note laptop is good , but it's overpriced and 73000 is almost equivalent to 900-1000 usd . Check models available in amazon.com for 1000$ u will understand.These models available in Amazon ind are mostly left over last gen models selling for overprice.It should be <55000 rs ."
5,"Like:- Performance: Decent laptop with good performance- Airflow and ventilation: This is the USP of this laptop, i also bought it for just this design.- The 3 Modes & Performance Mgmt: This laptop has three modes like Silent, Average & Performance and  it switches them automatically. You can also change the mode with ""fn + Q""- Power Option: It has a intelligent lenovo software that support ""rapid charging"" & ""conversion mode"". In  conversion mode the Laptop stops charging the battery at 60% and switches the power to online power  adapter thus saving the battery from overcharge. - Webcam: It has a privacy shutter toDislike:- Brightness: It's dull even with 50% brightness but will be ok if you work in dark- Battery backup: Have no expectation as it runs a graphic card- Position of hdmi & USB port: Ports are on the hot end. it feels like afterburner- SSD Size: 256 GB is too small for ""c drive"" you will end up installing steam on ""d drive""- Ram: Ram is just 8 GB- Webcam: The resolution is just 720p and doesn't support ""windows hello"""
1,"Refrain from buying Lenovo Laptop online, mine delivered with manufacturing defect, found after few months, now Lenovo issued DOA certificate which Amazon is not supporting. Lenovo in the process of repairing has damaged the laptop ... The laptops has plastic back and parts.. So better refrain from such poor laptops... Also my suggestion buy from local... Where you can go and get support with push atleast"
5,"first of all the built quality of this laptop is topnotch it has the heat insulating material and the powerfull fans , my use of laptop is very hardcore i use it daily 10-12 hours in which i do net browsing, gaming on high graphics, the more i use it the more i fall in love with it, and also the hARMAN speakers output is just phenomenal i listen songs while working the sound quality is the best i have ever heread in the laptop, really this product is way beyond my expectations, if r planning to buy it then just go and buy it blindly i assure u that u will be more happy ,"

5,Writing review after using it for couple of months. It is working perfectly fine for me. The laptop seems a good deal from Amazon as it is available at much higher price at the store with some extra features which are not provided by amazon. But its better to save money and buy from Amazon
5,It's very good laptop as per our expectationsThanks to Amazon & Dell.
1,Worst product. It is so hot uses after some time like 30 minutes.It purchase 3 days before.
2,üëé
5,I am using this laptop from last 4 months and it's working very well. It's fast because of SSD and RAM. Display is also very good. It's a good laptop for general use.

2,No aftersale service
5,"using since 3 months, Its a very good laptop but getting some heating issue otheriwise performance is greatmine were 8gb RAM and 256 gb SSD if purchasing try this config."
1,Disgusting experience with Dell's SET UP service. Despite my paying Rs 740 separately.Every time the SERVICE PROVIDER comes out with a new bluff. They should be punished üò°üò°
5,Best for office use quality build. Free Windows 11 upgrade. Office 2019 activated(once u open msword or any office 2019 product remember not office 365.). McAfee 15 moths activation..

4,Performance is excellent.But when I attach my pen tablet for teachingIt's hangsAnd I have to restart several timesIt may be due to windows 10
5,Look no further. Brand Dell says it all. Excellent laptop for Work from home and learn from home.
5,"Dell's 3505 is a 15.6-inch, lightweight laptop with an attractive body. It comes with installed Windows 10 (when you start the first time, it will ask to install Windows 11).As configured at Rs.41,999, it isn't a cheap laptop, but it doesn't look, feel, or perform like one, either. You have to upgrade the RAM for multitasking. It comes with an 8GB 3200 MHz RAM of Samsung. I have added the same RAM for better performance purposes. And now it works smoothly.It runs smoothly in heavy games like CS GO, GTA V...After installing those games, I don't have space to work on a hard drive! So, I have ordered WD 480GB SSD.My usual impression of laptop keyboards is either ""it's fine"" or ""it's an abomination."" So I bought a keyboard for gameplay.The battery and charger are perfect.The laptop starts heating so fast that you need to buy a cooling pad to use it. But who's mentioning in laptop reviews or comments that this laptop hangs. NO. IT'S A RUMOR."
5,"Great design and finish. Speed of Ryzen processor is excellent. I am using the laptop primarily for office work and I am very satisfied with its performance. Apps open fast. No hanging or heating of the machine. Wireless mouse is working well too.On the whole, this is a good laptop from Dell at a reasonable price. This is the second machine from Dell that I have purchased within 3 months."
1,Useless product.Never buy DELL Product.DELL Call centre will not help on the problem.LAPTOP is not working and call centre is not replying properly
5,"I have been using this laptop for 2 weeks now. Mainly purchased for my kids online classes. Some of the benefits i see are,1. Good speed. Laptop boots in less than 10 seconds. Maybe the SSD disks do the magic.2. Got update for windows 11. I have updated it and the performance is good.3. Display and Web Camera is great. Good to watch  videos in this screen.4. Got 2 years subscription for McAfee Antivirus.I am happy with the laptop performance. Using it for online classes and personal purposeThe build quality is okay. Doesn't look strong like earlier Dell Laptops, but not too bad. There is no DVD drive. After upgrades, i got around 155GB free space out of 256GB SSD.If you want to go with exchange, go with it. Definitely recommend it."
1,Worst battery performance and build quality is below average
1,Ram issue and ssd issueNo product warrantyI lost my 45000‚Çπ wasted by AmazonPls don‚Äôt buy

4,It has been a month I have been using this laptop for some work. Below are the major pros and cons of this laptop:Pros- Excellent battery life - at least 6-7 hours when fully charged- Easy to carry - lightweight- Build quality is great- multitasking is easy- smoother keyboard and boots instantlyCons- Heats up especially in the beginning- trackpad should be bigger- keyboard is not backlitOverall it is a good laptop for both personal and commercial purpose.
3,"Don't buy for gaming this lap is good mid range games and software, ram need to upgrade for smooth performance.Pos:It's excellent for watching movie with highqaiity soundUsing headphone you feel theatre experienceDisplay is goodDesign is too goodCons:Not for gamingBattery drain quicklyMaximum 16gb ram upgrade"
5,"I have the capacity to buy 60k worth laptop but my intent to use the laptop is for entertainment and study related to work. Find below my review:- For the price of Rs. 36,500 this laptop is worth every penny.- SSD hard drive, so no lag in opening and working on multiple stuff.- received firmware update, which is really good.- backlight for the Keyboard which you don't get even in a 40k worth HP laptop.- Sound is pretty loud. Loud enough to attend calls, watch movies and listen to songs. Sound is crisp and there is no shrill sounds.- Even the adapter for the laptop is not heavy.- touch is smooth and multi finger gesture is also very smooth. No lag during zooming.- Key travel on the keyboard is also good. Keys are soft.- light weight and very sturdy build quality.- Packaging had 2 carton layers and then the laptop carton box itself. Don't fear about any transit damages.- Camera is good enough to have a decent clarity during the call. Its very good in well lit condition.- Heat is very well managed and the fan sound is not audible during normal use.Cons:- Don't expect to play games in this laptop as this laptop is only for entertainment and study purpose. I dont play games so I dont care."
4,"1)No backlit keyboard even though it is mentioned in the description.Amazon team needs 2 days to resort that2)Laptop not booting after windows 11 update-again the amazon team needs 4 days to figure that out.Terrible experience.People should buy it from a store so that they can help in person rather wasting time over customer care like I did.4 hours of call and no resolution.Update after using it for 2 days:-The laptop is very good when it is on windows 10.Fast and build quality is strong.On 8 gb it is smooth,will be a beast on 20 gb.Update after a week :-One word-Fast & worth the price.The config is better than the other brands which charge 5k extra.Upgrade ram in that cost difference."
4,Value for money product but the screen quality is good poor some time it defecult to read sound quality of system is also good
5,Everything is fine but a little disappointment as there's no lifetime subscription for ms office 365.That's it as of now. Enjoy!
4,Writing the review after using two days of laptop. It‚Äôs was slim and good. Best part is boot time due to SSD. Few issues with fan because placed in front  of screen.
4,I dislike the fact that they write there is a backlit keyboard if it is not present and Microsoft Office 365 subscription is only a one month trial rest the laptop is beast at 8 gb ram very fastNeed 8 seconds to boot up
5,Excellent quality fit and finish. Nice keyboard and mousepad. All latest features. Successfully updated windows 11. Highly recommended. Thank you Amazon for excellent customer service.
5,SSD Makes it very fast i must say but don't buy it for gaming or editing couse screen quality is below average otherwise all good.
4,Value for money product cause 256GB SSD and 1TB HHD and clock speed is good for this price range. It's very slim product. Already installed ms office in this  product. Sound is Little bit slow. Picture quality is average.
5,"After two days......I m giving this laptop 5 stars, I will update my review if needed. I was confused after reading negative reviews but now I m satisfied with my buy. If ms office available for life time this will be excellent. Battery backup nice..... Screen quality nice.....Look is awesome.....Nd light weight.Amazon's exchange process is so good....."
4,"Almost instant boot-up (OS is installed on a 256 GB SSD). One would require to buy an additional hard disk for increasing the storage capacity. Otherwise, a decent laptop. Would have been happier with more RAM and a larger capacity Hard Disk."
1,"Worst screen resolution...,no Microsoft office installed.  Don't buy.... Go for Hp 14s silver by using some extra money ...."
5,Its one of best machine i3 11th genRam can be expanded one slot bis available abd u can even upgrade ssd/hdd but u cannot do it by uself as warranty will be void.Acer service center charge 450 rs  for installation we can purchase our ram  and ssd/hdd.Best buy

5,The Laptop is very good one as compare to other brand like lenovo or dell. In this price range it is the best one. I recommend for this who wants to buy this. I am using for last 3 months.
4,"So far everything‚Äôs great..Screen quality,speed is good..just one thing that might cause problem in future is the plastic frame of the screen,its loose and dont feel that strong..lets see.."
4,It gets heated during watching OTTs. Rest everything else is excellent.
4,"It's a decent laptop which fits my requirements. However, the battery charger heats up very fast. It's better to charge the laptop in two stages to avoid the overheating of charger.This surely needs to be looked at."
1,The seller has refused to provide complimentary 1 year amazon prime membership which was written in the offers when i purchased the product.Now the amazon team is saying there was no such offer.Very disspointed by the seller

4,"Except hearing issue .......everything is worth while .......build quality is superb, screen is good, battery backup is 4-5 hrs, non backlit keyboard, no ms office license included, but you get what you pay for , still at this price it's a big yes......just one con that it heats lil bit more....."
5,The Laptop is very good one as compare to other brand like lenovo or dell. In this price range it is the best one. I recommend for this who wants to buy this. I am using for last 3 months.
4,"So far everything‚Äôs great..Screen quality,speed is good..just one thing that might cause problem in future is the plastic frame of the screen,its loose and dont feel that strong..lets see.."
4,It gets heated during watching OTTs. Rest everything else is excellent.
4,"It's a decent laptop which fits my requirements. However, the battery charger heats up very fast. It's better to charge the laptop in two stages to avoid the overheating of charger.This surely needs to be looked at."
1,The seller has refused to provide complimentary 1 year amazon prime membership which was written in the offers when i purchased the product.Now the amazon team is saying there was no such offer.Very disspointed by the seller
4,"Laptop is good but don't buy with Amazon being prime member didn't receive my product on time and it is sill missing a product , worst delivery partner ever ,waste of time and money with Amazon ."
3,I got this laptop for 35k. Performance is good. Likes the laptop except for the display. Display has a whitish glow which makes it difficult to read text on screen
5,Excellent product. Overall experience is good and happy to use acer aspire series.
3,I would like speed .I didn't like small screen size and weight
3,"Good product, only issue I find so far was scrolling through touch pad not possible which is very annoying while working on laptop."
5,Excellent product for value of money.
1,"The keyboard and touchpad are not working properly,lot of heat and worst product from the Acer company"

1,Defective.
5,"Nice product! It's super fast, average camera quality, screen is good.It has a 8gigs of RAM, 2gigs of graphic memory (RX vega 3), fast processor, 256gigs of memory which is enough if you don't want to install big files/games in it.PS: Good for programming!It can handle softwares which require graphic memory descently(I've tried playing old games like nfsmw 2005, gts vc and San Andreas which ran smoothly, storage problem may occur if you will try to install too many at once, so keep a check on it)Also, softwares like Android Studio, AutoCAD 2022, Unity 3d, Unreal Engine 4 run smoothly on it.Gta 5 can run on it too at low settings smoothly but heating issue will pop up then!Battery is good(can run upto 6-7 hrs if not doing heavy gaming or similar work, 2-3 hrs if gaming /using heavy softwares continuously.Overall, a good laptop!"
4,"Likes:1. Excellent boot up time with new NVME SSD. Measured it, just took 5.8s. ASUS claims that there is additional 2.5‚Äù SSD slot which is empty, but I haven‚Äôt verified it2.

5,Fast response....no lag....light weight.....good battery backup....nice display
5,"At this price point, this is one of the best laptops. Performance is faster, lightweight, and also looks great. I have another laptop with the same screen size. Because of the comparatively smaller bezels on this laptop, this looks very small. Impressed with the performance. No lagging. I am usually not a fan of Windows but I am not feeling any slowness (may be because of the faster SSD) on this laptop so I am kind of liking it. üòÅ Also it provides a decent battery backup and performs well even if it is not plugged in."
1,"I bought this on 5/Dec/2021. Been a laptop user for ages. On the Amazon portal the specs looked great and seems to fit for basic needs.  Upon trying it out I found that the two major issues with the laptop that outweighs certain plus.1) Very Poor Screen Quality. Does not meet the needs of even basic users. Colors fade even if you tilt by 5-10 Degree. Nothing to say about contrast as I could not feel it at all. Brightness adjustment is there. But nothing much can be done. It claims to be 220 Nits screen. Does not seems to be really so.2)  Webcam quality is horrible. It is like having a VGA camera from old Nokia cell phoneMain reason for me to chose the laptop were 14‚Äù size, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD. I took screen quality and Camera for granted as I though a Company like Asus will not falter there. But, it is a worst product.  Don‚Äôt go for it."
4,I liked the compact and light weight design and overall it's a good budget laptop for office work and daily usage .Cons :I didn't got the micro sd card port in my product I don't know why because in specifications there are but didn't got it .

5,"Delivered in Just 2 days,this is the first time i am using MSI laptop and Trust me ..one of the best display and Cool Keyboard.. Obviously Good for gaming and other things.."
5,Just go for it amazing productPros: i7 10th gen is best processor in this price rangeYou can add storage and most importantly ram is expandable upto 64gb which is freaking awsome.144hz screen is flawless.Now cons: material quality is metal but low level plastic is used with it. Battery drains even in normal usage.touchpad in not upto the mark like it works but not that much smooth.
5,Good gaming laptop shoudl be relaunched in high graphic card version
2,After 1 month it is crashing and not opening and not working. better get warranty
5,Love the look...till now performance is above question.will provide further after using more.
5,"I think its worth for the price , good shape and display quality the performance is way too better, all over ver impressive"
5,"Although it's a good laptop.For gaming and everything else, it's Good and in this price it's a good deal. At Amazon it's very good deal."
1,I bought this laptop a month back and it suddenly stopped charging. The service center guy said that the motherboard is not working. The service center says that they are not empowered to replace it with a new laptop and can only repair the mother board. Very disappointing interaction with the service center because they have no power to make any decisions to keep the customer happy.There is no mechanism to talk to any personnel who are incharge of the AVITA brand like the leadership or sales/marketing teams. The emails and contacts found on the websites donot fetch any response. I could not establish contact with anyone who cares about the AVITA brand and would take some initiative to keep its customers base happy. Thus I would not recommend this brand to anyone.
1,"After reading all great review I bought this laptop.Unfortunately I received a laptop which doesnt switches on. So tried returning it, BUT YOU CANT RETURN IT, without a technical person visit you to check it. So fixed a technician visit after 2 days. But the technician never turned up. Tried calling amazon, but no help coming from amazon. So they are fixing another technician again after another 2 days. If this is the case with a city like Bangalore, imagine other places. So stay away from this brand."
3,"Looks  of this laptop is good, but ssd seems to be slow  maximum writing speed is 40 Mbps.. Battery life is about 6 hours. Twice it happened that laptop showed 5 % battery after full charge and got shutdown and after some time without charging it started fully charged. So planning to contact service center if that situation again persist.I have used it for a year and it is working fine. It can put any premium laptop feeling  ashamed of its price."
1,Before you buy Avita brand laptop you have to be very cautious as Avita does not have any relieble customer service in India. They do not respond to calls and tweets.If you run in trouble Amazon just will ask you to speak to Avita who doesn't talk.Avita s customer service is just a 1800 number which are handled by a third party and you do not talk to Avita. Zero communication from actual Avita company.Products can be defective very low quality control. Avita and Amazon India thrives on low customer protection in India. They cannot sell these products in EU or USA or Japan. They bin all defective products in India. I personally have been duped by Amazon and Avita s ugly nexus. 1 month with a new dead laptop.Very sad and deeply anguished.Sharing my personal experience. Keep your eyes open if you wish peace of mind.
1,"Good product in this range from China. I liked overall performance of the laptop, video call on Cisco webex. No heating problem at all. Battery use to drained 15-18% over night from switched off at night (100%) and switched on at morning (85-83%)."
1,"I had never reviewed any products. After seeing so many positive reviews  I would like to mention my experience, don't know about  the positive reviews even I bought seeing those positive reviews only. But the reality is very bad. My worst experience ever.becaz so far I never faced any issues even in entry level laptops.Pros: Attractive specs, brilliant Display,top class built quality and very compactCons:so many things worst battery, ports are tight,takes more time to charge, heating issues, so much of lag couldn't able to do proper operations Requested for replacement.Will update once after using the replaced product.Trust me guys. I would recommend i3 high end generantion instead of this one."
1,"When I first order it, it came with a manufacturing defect or finishing defect.Then I had a word with Mr. Rohan and he had ordered another unit for in replacement. But to my wonder I got a new laptop or you can say a new headache as when I completely charged this replaced new laptop upto 100% and then I switched it off. Later when I opened the laptop it is showing battery as only 6%.This is a fraud and the biggest shock of my life."
5,"Just An Amazing Product.Initially i was searching for an laptop which fill my need at around 35k pricing ..but suddenly just after 15th of june due to the heavy demand the laptop companies increased their prices for up to 10-15k for every laptops ...and i was looking to buy Asus Vivobook 15 but as they are not coming to their actual pricing, and the sale day started i saw a product named Avita Liber V14 at an amazing pricing of 36k so i ordered it bcz it filled more than the actual reqirement of Mine.. with 512 GB SSD +8 GB DDR4 Ram... But as got confused bcz of Brand value,after sales service and also due to my friends suggestion i cancelled my order.. then i was in a great regret that i missed an awesome product just for some creepy thoughts and suggestions üòÇ... Then i went with my Inner instinct i ordered it again ... At same price ...Pros:1) super Fast.. boot time is 7-8 secs ...2) Finger print scanner is Ultra fast and accurate. It catches 9/10 times perfectly.3)Screen quality is Way way better than of HP , Lenovo, Asus and many Others..4) Battery Life is around 7-8 hrs if Normal usage ..without internet it goes to around 9-10 hrs...and if you use it for online video streaming it will last for around 5 Hrs .. and if your usage is somebit combination of all that it will give backup up to 6.5-7 hrs.5) Built Quality is Best in this Range you will never gonna find such Quality in 30 - 55k range.6) It is Ultra Slim.. you will only feel its slimness when u gonna hold it in your hand.7) Super Light weight.8)Alone in Segment ...You Can Open it by only single Hand..9) TrackPad is super Large i have never seen such large Trackpad in any Laptop.10) Backlit Keyboard ...which has adjustable lightsCONS:1) Camera is not that much good. It is as good as any other laptos in this Range only.2) Micro HDMI which should not be their .. it should be a full HDMI port.3) Charging is Slow, it will take around 2.5-3 hrs to get fully charged from 0-100%.4) It just has 39.9 W Charger.5) Drivers are not available to download in the website.. but you will get it pre installed in the laptop.(In the Website it is showing Nothing may they Fix this Soon)6) Found Some Lag while Playing some videos on youtube (It was just Minor but have to mention it).Note: will change the review if find any issue in it in future. This was my initial overview."
1,"Poor battery life,laptop battery heating too much while charging ,laptop fan cant cool the heat generated by laptop and laptop giving me electric vibration type shocks(negligible) while charging.......except battery dipartment others good.........laptop sometimes hanged too(curser stops at some points).......for gods sake dont buy this product...... specially from this seller (i got a 2nd hand product)both orginal seal and amazon package was open............ light weight laptop, very thin metal body,display is good,backlit keyboard, dont go just for processor you cant even browse and charge at the same time..... to much heat generated by laptop.."
5,"Avita Liber 14 laptop is the one that made me realise that how the so called professional YouTube Reviewers are running for their money from the brands. It's so freaking that how not even a single established reviewer reviewed this laptop model which is astoundingly Premium, light weight and wonderfully performing device in the segment for a totally good value of money. I don't want to use the word less price or cheap since it would degrade the device's real value.Hats off to Avita who had made this premium features reach everyone irrespective of their wealth. I salute them.May be they might have shown some weakness in their PURA segments but that too they made that reachable to students who would only have less money.But Liber v14 ... God I waited to review this device after using it atleast few days. It did show only greatness and no negatives.1. Beautiful very thin, light and handy than lighter HP, ASUS, Lenovo2. Superb metal finish all around with wonderful Diamond cutting outside and inside3. Wonderful screen with superb colours which you can't even see in even 50K plus laotops with other brands4. Almost bezelless screen surprising you whenever you look at it5. Very well performing keyboard and trackpad which won't disappoint you6. High performance for all your non gaming tasks(I am not find of games and hence didn't run any but with its power it will surely run all games equivalent to its power)7. Fastest boot and highly responsive finger print8. Worth while web cam with indicator light9. Color changing Indicator for charging and charged at the place of charging pin10. Enough amount of ports11. 512gb SSD with 540+ MB/s Read and write speed which will amaze you12. i5 10th gen with 8gb DDR4 RAM for such an affordable price13. Very good battery life equivalent to other brands of 50+K range(solid 5 hours avg)The only negative point I believe is that the option of fast charging missing with low watt charger but this is acceptable for a professional user.God this Avita saved me ‚Çπ25000 for the same spec and thin laptops with other brands. Infact it was a surprise to me when I found it and I was skeptical since not even a single popular techy in YouTube had reviwed this. But real common man reviews on this laptop had shown me the truth and life. I appreciate Avita for their strong endurance against these money minded Reviewers. It clearly opened my eyes about the product Reviewers.People who are complaning about this laptop is like a joke to me and they don't know how to find a device for their style of specific use.I want Avita to grow bigger and bigger and they will and they will have service centers all-over Indian towns very fast.I am really proud of those common consumers who did strive hard to post the truth about this laptop and the company to help common man know about the true quality of this device.Hats off Avita and your flagship killing common man Idea"
5,Very nice product. I got this product on exchange offer I'm 24k. It's value for money. Very light weight. Every thing is good except front camera.
1,"Product is defective. A small dot appears in screen. Received refund in 45 days that too after 3, 4 times complained on Amazon and one final complain on Twitter. Just loved the service they provided. This experience says never buy product of big amount."
5,"Hi all ,I was the first one to buy this laptop and this machine is providing a great experience.I baught this laptop to take my python learning  next level,  I searched multiple I5 + 8 gb laptop's which was my minimum requirements and there was no machine with good reviews below 50,000.I got this laptop for 33700 with sbi card discount and I believe I saved 17 thousand by not going for another companies laptop.I am loving the finger print it's like opening a phone and start using .."
1,purchased from amazon .after 1 month display colour is like a hotspot..no one taking calls.no reply frm service numbers.only after 1 month of purchase.what can i do?hot spot is spreading
5,"I bought this laptop for development purposes primarily. I am a full stack developer an I wanted to install and work with multiple IDEs.The laptop is small in size, but is very powerful. I am able to develop Android apps as faster as I would do in my Octa-Core PC. Honestly, I didn't expect this laptop to have that much power. I was surprised by its performance.Battery is decent. Watching movies, playing songs and some basic works can provide you 6 hour backup. Whereas tasks like development of apps on Android IDE can provide you with approximately 2-3 hour backup.Materials are nice, speakers are good and gives a premium look. Display is great. Touch pad is smooth and it is large so much better comfort.Highly recommended."
5,"It's just beautiful. A gift to my wife is just perfect. Very sleek, very lightweight, backlit keyboard, after setup, windows starting in less than 7 sec. Shut down in 4 sec. This is starting.Cons screen view display is not as expected. Slight disappointed. Office 365 is only 30 day subscription. Very light build. Feels like glass.For this price just go a head and surprise yourself.It's working fine not as said by many reviewers. Bad luck they might face the problem. Mine in good mint condition.My writing speed was 112mbps."
3,"Good lapt at this price for those many features. Only issues are1. Heating even for normal tasks2. When the laptop gets heated, cooling fan gets started and then you will hear the sound as though you are standing near to a jet engine.."
4,"My initial impressions are good with this laptop as like any other electronic devices, the real picture one would be able to predict only when it travels along with you and last with you without giving any further trouble. like anyone else I bought this one only with my inner instinct and what made me so strong is that this Liber V model date release shows 5th Aug 2020 and also the tech specifications/configurations for the deal price it offered me.Amazon packaging I would say is pretty average at least for this model but the package done by manufacturer was good as it included all the safety thing that prevents wobbling around during movement. one cannot expect additional accessories with this price ranges except power adaptor and cable.For day to day usage it's good, They've made good quality keyboard, keyboard travel was nice, Finger print reader is so fast, back lit keyboard made me the night amazing in case I'd to do some task during dark at night but be make sure to reduce your display brightness to low and prevent from eye strain as well as battery draining. Battery is giving good backup of more than 6 hrs. if the machine only used for browsing web pages/do any programming stuff other than watching movies but one-thing really hurts me is that charging time, It's insane as I'd to plugged in nearly 5 to 5 1/2 hrs. when I have been using in standby. In case you plugged in to charge during shut down, You can expect the same battery to charge completely within 2 hrs.Before updating the graphic card, the display quality I felt was poor in terms of image quality embedded in web browser while you scrolling down you may notice or English characters that's appeared in any software tools but later when I got the update, the same has been improved quite a bit it's not like I haven't checked image settings but this is what I observed.Fan noise is coming when you doing any installations/Windows update running in background otherwise it's silent on normal stuff. When you charging battery the right side area around the keyboard where you plugged in, tends to get warm. Also the back gets slight heat but that's normal in any laptops. Since it comes with matt color, the screen will not allow any reflection of light in-front and it's Full HD IPS display, So anyone can experience good media consumption."
5,Waw this is very nice product I like it. I was buy this product 35990/- in this price I never seen any laptop in this configuration other products is Very high rate near about 50k.this laptop is very slim n lightweight I am very happy.if you want to purchase a laptop for real work you can go with avita and if you want to show only the brand name  and logo you can go with any other brands.
1,Cheap Chinese product don't buy..
1,Avita libre laptop looks cool and performs well but i got an issue where camera and microphone stopped working . Service guy came and picked the product in 3 days but its been more than 15 days and issue is not rectified . I feel to go with established  brand like hp dell or Lenovo where the service turn around time was good . Camera stopped working with in a month of purchase . I would never go with avita brand .
5,was disappointed by seeing poor built quality review of avita pura plasic one. but this one is completely different. it is made of full aluminum. ips display. and all other features which premium laptop has. battery backup is 5-7 hrs using cad software WHICH IS REALLY GREAT. the speed is really awesome. backlit keyboard and fingerprint enhance the user experience. the build quality and hinge is really good and feels durable.
5,I did purchase this laptop on the basis of earlier reviews about the product and brand. Before that I never know about this brand itself. This model launched on 3rd August and I bought on 8th Aug.Design and quality of laptop and all its features is sa expected. You will not find all features at this price range. But still I saw people criticize it as they were getting better in 34k than this. I would prefer this laptop if you need a laptop for all daily home or office work. I bought it for my daughter almost a month back and working fine.
4,Awesome profuct very nicely build.Very good quality screen.But the speaker are not soo good as i was expecting but it sound nice...Allover ....a very good productLoved it
5,"The laptop is ultra lightweight. Build quality is top notch with minimal flex.The trackpad is large. Probably the biggest I've ever seen on a windows machine.The display provided is of highest quality. Probably the eye catching feature of this laptop.Type C port is versatile. It doubles as a display output and PD 2.0 charging. Buy any 45W PD charger and type C hdmi dongle to have clean desktop experience. This is a feature that is sorely missed in Mi Notebooks.Battery size and the bundled charger is small. It takes a long time to charge. Forget quick top-up. It will take 3 hours to charge fully. It is a shame considering how good the laptop is. The laptop can last upto 5 hrs on continuous usage at medium battery settings.There are no other laptops at this price range that offers all these features. Similarly speced laptop from Asus, Acer, HP cost around 60k.Only issue is the brand name. But, I'm willing to take the risk for the featue set. Only time will tell about the reliability.At 35-40k this is a good buy."
1,"Charging slot is not good, and Charging time require 5 hrs."
1,There is a white dot in that laptop and power button not responding it seems that low quality . check the white dot while playing a youtube video also . Please check the laptop properly
5,"After going through all the previous comments that this laptops have not been able to work properly, but trust me guys, its better to go for this unit. You can get this Spexs in this price.The Speed is really great, wether you are a working professional or an student.Display and Sound is impressive üî•üî•Had played AOE DE 2 and 3, CS Global, Pubg Lite, GtaV & Pes. Everything works.üî•üî•Go for it. Very Slim. This is as exact as MacbooküòÉüòÉ"
4,"it was amazing laptop with lightening speed, don't hesitate to buy, they are providing amazing features than any laptop else and also coming with 2 year warranty. iam using it for almost 1 month but its really working good and looks amazing, so far hundreds of people asked to the prize and other features, they are amazed the features that are providing at this prize. so i suggest you to buy if your are expecting everyday and multitasking laptop. it is one of the best at this range. battery life also very decent (7-8 hrs) for moderate use. it was one of the masterpiece for students."
1,"The product is not at all of any good quality. The customer service and after-sales service are pathetic and they do not provide ANY support. There are extremely less service centers, that too only in major metro cities, and the service provided is pathetic and they are extremely rude.  We regret the purchase of this laptop, and many issues creep up over a period of time. My touchpad stopped working in a month itself, software issues, driver errors, etc. When they try to fix the touchpad issue, after weeks of follow-up, sensor and blue tooth issues came up. We are still trying to follow up with them to fix this issue but there is no satisfactory answers or solutions is provided till now.Would never recommend it as it is a huge hassle for the consumer after the purchase. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THIS PRODUCT and waste your time, energy, and Money. ""Selling inferior quality without any customer suppot"" Please be aware and Amazon should blacklist such company."
5,Laptop's performance & quality is very good but Amazon services are too bad first time i got laptop with dent in replacement got damaged laptop... Totally worst services... And all customer care representative give different different answers... After answering they don't accept that they spoke those words... I suggest never buy costly products from Amazon.... üôÇ
4,I am writing this review after using 5 days.Everything is perfect except following.1. Camera is 1M so not clear as other laptop.2. Battery is running out after 4 hrs in normal usage3. To get full charge it is taking 4-5hrs as it not c-type charger4. Battery Charging pin is too loose so you have to be careful during charging.
1,"i faced the troubles1 - replaced in 7 days by amazon - fault speaker and battery issue2 - 1st complaints jan21 - battery replace but fault not solved and new fault keyboard not work3 - 2nd complaints  feb21- keyboard replace - after 1 day facing fitting issue and battery issue same4 - in future, march 21 they will be change  system motherboard -don't go with youtube reviews...in my view -- you have to buy another brand laptops such as dell or hp or asus"

So tried returning it, BUT YOU CANT RETURN IT, without a technical person visit you to check it. So fixed a technician visit after 2 days. But the technician never turned up. Tried calling amazon, but no help coming from amazon. So they are fixing another technician again after another 2 days. If this is the case with a city like Bangalore, imagine other places. So stay away from this brand."
3,"Looks  of this laptop is good, but ssd seems to be slow  maximum writing speed is 40 Mbps.. Battery life is about 6 hours.

So planning to contact service center if that situation again persist.I have used it for a year and it is working fine. It can put any premium laptop feeling  ashamed of its price."
1,Before you buy Avita brand laptop you have to be very cautious as Avita does not have any relieble customer service in India. They do not respond to calls and tweets.If you run in trouble Amazon just will ask you to speak to Avita who doesn't talk.Avita s customer service is just a 1800 number which are handled by a third party and you do not talk to Avita. Zero communication from actual Avita company.Products can be defective very low quality control. Avita and Amazon India thrives on low customer protection in India. They cannot sell these products in EU or USA or Japan. They bin all defective products in India. I personally have been duped by Amazon and Avita s ugly nexus. 1 month with a new dead laptop.Very sad and deeply anguished.Sharing my personal experience. Keep your eyes open if you wish peace of mind.
1,"Good product in this range from China. I liked overall performance of the laptop, video call on Cisco webex. No heating problem at all. Battery use to drained 15-18% over night from switched off at night (100%) and switched on at morning (85-83%)."
1,"I had never reviewed any products. After seeing so many positive reviews  I would like to mention my experience, don't know about  the positive reviews even I bought seeing those positive reviews only. But the reality is very bad. My worst experience ever.becaz so far I never faced any issues even in entry level laptops.Pros: Attractive specs, brilliant Display,top class built quality and very compactCons:so many things worst battery, ports are tight,takes more time to charge, heating issues, so much of lag couldn't able to do proper operations Requested for replacement.Will update once after using the replaced product.Trust me guys. I would recommend i3 high end generantion instead of this one."
1,"When I first order it, it came with a manufacturing defect or finishing defect.Then I had a word with Mr. Rohan and he had ordered another unit for in replacement. But to my wonder I got a new laptop or you can say a new headache as when I completely charged this replaced new laptop upto 100% and then I switched it off. Later when I opened the laptop it is showing battery as only 6%.This is a fraud and the biggest shock of my life."
5,"Just An Amazing Product.Initially i was searching for an laptop which fill my need at around 35k pricing ..but suddenly just after 15th of june due to the heavy demand the laptop companies increased their prices for up to 10-15k for every laptops ...and i was looking to buy Asus Vivobook 15 but as they are not coming to their actual pricing, and the sale day started i saw a product named Avita Liber V14 at an amazing pricing of 36k so i ordered it bcz it filled more than the actual reqirement of Mine.. with 512 GB SSD +8 GB DDR4 Ram... But as got confused bcz of Brand value,after sales service and also due to my friends suggestion i cancelled my order.. then i was in a great regret that i missed an awesome product just for some creepy thoughts and suggestions üòÇ... Then i went with my Inner instinct i ordered it again ... At same price ...Pros:1) super Fast.. boot time is 7-8 secs ...2) Finger print scanner is Ultra fast and accurate. It catches 9/10 times perfectly.3)Screen quality is Way way better than of HP , Lenovo, Asus and many Others..4) Battery Life is around 7-8 hrs if Normal usage ..without internet it goes to around 9-10 hrs...and if you use it for online video streaming it will last for around 5 Hrs .. and if your usage is somebit combination of all that it will give backup up to 6.5-7 hrs.5) Built Quality is Best in this Range you will never gonna find such Quality in 30 - 55k range.6) It is Ultra Slim.. you will only feel its slimness when u gonna hold it in your hand.7) Super Light weight.8)Alone in Segment ...You Can Open it by only single Hand..9) TrackPad is super Large i have never seen such large Trackpad in any Laptop.10) Backlit Keyboard ...which has adjustable lightsCONS:1) Camera is not that much good. It is as good as any other laptos in this Range only.2) Micro HDMI which should not be their .. it should be a full HDMI port.3) Charging is Slow, it will take around 2.5-3 hrs to get fully charged from 0-100%.4) It just has 39.9 W Charger.5) Drivers are not available to download in the website.. but you will get it pre installed in the laptop.(In the Website it is showing Nothing may they Fix this Soon)6) Found Some Lag while Playing some videos on youtube (It was just Minor but have to mention it).Note: will change the review if find any issue in it in future. This was my initial overview."
1,"Poor battery life,laptop battery heating too much while charging ,laptop fan cant cool the heat generated by laptop and laptop giving me electric vibration type shocks(negligible) while charging.......except battery dipartment others good.........laptop sometimes hanged too(curser stops at some points).......for gods sake dont buy this product...... specially from this seller (i got a 2nd hand product)both orginal seal and amazon package was open............ light weight laptop, very thin metal body,display is good,backlit keyboard, dont go just for processor you cant even browse and charge at the same time..... to much heat generated by laptop.."
5,"Avita Liber 14 laptop is the one that made me realise that how the so called professional YouTube Reviewers are running for their money from the brands. It's so freaking that how not even a single established reviewer reviewed this laptop model which is astoundingly Premium, light weight and wonderfully performing device in the segment for a totally good value of money. I don't want to use the word less price or cheap since it would degrade the device's real value.Hats off to Avita who had made this premium features reach everyone irrespective of their wealth. I salute them.May be they might have shown some weakness in their PURA segments but that too they made that reachable to students who would only have less money.But Liber v14 ... God I waited to review this device after using it atleast few days. It did show only greatness and no negatives.1. Beautiful very thin, light and handy than lighter HP, ASUS, Lenovo2. Superb metal finish all around with wonderful Diamond cutting outside and inside3. Wonderful screen with superb colours which you can't even see in even 50K plus laotops with other brands4. Almost bezelless screen surprising you whenever you look at it5. Very well performing keyboard and trackpad which won't disappoint you6. High performance for all your non gaming tasks(I am not find of games and hence didn't run any but with its power it will surely run all games equivalent to its power)7. Fastest boot and highly responsive finger print8. Worth while web cam with indicator light9. Color changing Indicator for charging and charged at the place of charging pin10. Enough amount of ports11. 512gb SSD with 540+ MB/s Read and write speed which will amaze you12. i5 10th gen with 8gb DDR4 RAM for such an affordable price13. Very good battery life equivalent to other brands of 50+K range(solid 5 hours avg)The only negative point I believe is that the option of fast charging missing with low watt charger but this is acceptable for a professional user.God this Avita saved me ‚Çπ25000 for the same spec and thin laptops with other brands. Infact it was a surprise to me when I found it and I was skeptical since not even a single popular techy in YouTube had reviwed this. But real common man reviews on this laptop had shown me the truth and life. I appreciate Avita for their strong endurance against these money minded Reviewers. It clearly opened my eyes about the product Reviewers.People who are complaning about this laptop is like a joke to me and they don't know how to find a device for their style of specific use.I want Avita to grow bigger and bigger and they will and they will have service centers all-over Indian towns very fast.I am really proud of those common consumers who did strive hard to post the truth about this laptop and the company to help common man know about the true quality of this device.Hats off Avita and your flagship killing common man Idea"
5,Very nice product. I got this product on exchange offer I'm 24k. It's value for money. Very light weight. Every thing is good except front camera.
1,"Product is defective. A small dot appears in screen. Received refund in 45 days that too after 3, 4 times complained on Amazon and one final complain on Twitter. Just loved the service they provided. This experience says never buy product of big amount."
5,"Hi all ,I was the first one to buy this laptop and this machine is providing a great experience.I baught this laptop to take my python learning  next level,  I searched multiple I5 + 8 gb laptop's which was my minimum requirements and there was no machine with good reviews below 50,000.I got this laptop for 33700 with sbi card discount and I believe I saved 17 thousand by not going for another companies laptop.I am loving the finger print it's like opening a phone and start using .."
1,purchased from amazon .after 1 month display colour is like a hotspot..no one taking calls.no reply frm service numbers.only after 1 month of purchase.what can i do?hot spot is spreading
5,"I bought this laptop for development purposes primarily. I am a full stack developer an I wanted to install and work with multiple IDEs.The laptop is small in size, but is very powerful. I am able to develop Android apps as faster as I would do in my Octa-Core PC. Honestly, I didn't expect this laptop to have that much power. I was surprised by its performance.Battery is decent. Watching movies, playing songs and some basic works can provide you 6 hour backup. Whereas tasks like development of apps on Android IDE can provide you with approximately 2-3 hour backup.Materials are nice, speakers are good and gives a premium look. Display is great. Touch pad is smooth and it is large so much better comfort.Highly recommended."
5,"It's just beautiful. A gift to my wife is just perfect. Very sleek, very lightweight, backlit keyboard, after setup, windows starting in less than 7 sec. Shut down in 4 sec. This is starting.Cons screen view display is not as expected. Slight disappointed. Office 365 is only 30 day subscription. Very light build. Feels like glass.For this price just go a head and surprise yourself.It's working fine not as said by many reviewers. Bad luck they might face the problem. Mine in good mint condition.My writing speed was 112mbps."
3,"Good lapt at this price for those many features. Only issues are1. Heating even for normal tasks2. When the laptop gets heated, cooling fan gets started and then you will hear the sound as though you are standing near to a jet engine.."
4,"My initial impressions are good with this laptop as like any other electronic devices, the real picture one would be able to predict only when it travels along with you and last with you without giving any further trouble. like anyone else I bought this one only with my inner instinct and what made me so strong is that this Liber V model date release shows 5th Aug 2020 and also the tech specifications/configurations for the deal price it offered me.Amazon packaging I would say is pretty average at least for this model but the package done by manufacturer was good as it included all the safety thing that prevents wobbling around during movement. one cannot expect additional accessories with this price ranges except power adaptor and cable.For day to day usage it's good, They've made good quality keyboard, keyboard travel was nice, Finger print reader is so fast, back lit keyboard made me the night amazing in case I'd to do some task during dark at night but be make sure to reduce your display brightness to low and prevent from eye strain as well as battery draining. Battery is giving good backup of more than 6 hrs. if the machine only used for browsing web pages/do any programming stuff other than watching movies but one-thing really hurts me is that charging time, It's insane as I'd to plugged in nearly 5 to 5 1/2 hrs. when I have been using in standby. In case you plugged in to charge during shut down, You can expect the same battery to charge completely within 2 hrs.Before updating the graphic card, the display quality I felt was poor in terms of image quality embedded in web browser while you scrolling down you may notice or English characters that's appeared in any software tools but later when I got the update, the same has been improved quite a bit it's not like I haven't checked image settings but this is what I observed.Fan noise is coming when you doing any installations/Windows update running in background otherwise it's silent on normal stuff. When you charging battery the right side area around the keyboard where you plugged in, tends to get warm. Also the back gets slight heat but that's normal in any laptops. Since it comes with matt color, the screen will not allow any reflection of light in-front and it's Full HD IPS display, So anyone can experience good media consumption."
5,Waw this is very nice product I like it. I was buy this product 35990/- in this price I never seen any laptop in this configuration other products is Very high rate near about 50k.this laptop is very slim n lightweight I am very happy.if you want to purchase a laptop for real work you can go with avita and if you want to show only the brand name  and logo you can go with any other brands.
1,Cheap Chinese product don't buy..
1,Avita libre laptop looks cool and performs well but i got an issue where camera and microphone stopped working . Service guy came and picked the product in 3 days but its been more than 15 days and issue is not rectified . I feel to go with established  brand like hp dell or Lenovo where the service turn around time was good . Camera stopped working with in a month of purchase . I would never go with avita brand .
5,was disappointed by seeing poor built quality review of avita pura plasic one. but this one is completely different. it is made of full aluminum. ips display. and all other features which premium laptop has. battery backup is 5-7 hrs using cad software WHICH IS REALLY GREAT. the speed is really awesome. backlit keyboard and fingerprint enhance the user experience. the build quality and hinge is really good and feels durable.
5,I did purchase this laptop on the basis of earlier reviews about the product and brand. Before that I never know about this brand itself. This model launched on 3rd August and I bought on 8th Aug.Design and quality of laptop and all its features is sa expected. You will not find all features at this price range. But still I saw people criticize it as they were getting better in 34k than this. I would prefer this laptop if you need a laptop for all daily home or office work. I bought it for my daughter almost a month back and working fine.
4,Awesome profuct very nicely build.Very good quality screen.But the speaker are not soo good as i was expecting but it sound nice...Allover ....a very good productLoved it
5,"The laptop is ultra lightweight. Build quality is top notch with minimal flex.The trackpad is large. Probably the biggest I've ever seen on a windows machine.The display provided is of highest quality. Probably the eye catching feature of this laptop.Type C port is versatile. It doubles as a display output and PD 2.0 charging. Buy any 45W PD charger and type C hdmi dongle to have clean desktop experience. This is a feature that is sorely missed in Mi Notebooks.Battery size and the bundled charger is small. It takes a long time to charge. Forget quick top-up. It will take 3 hours to charge fully. It is a shame considering how good the laptop is. The laptop can last upto 5 hrs on continuous usage at medium battery settings.There are no other laptops at this price range that offers all these features. Similarly speced laptop from Asus, Acer, HP cost around 60k.Only issue is the brand name. But, I'm willing to take the risk for the featue set. Only time will tell about the reliability.At 35-40k this is a good buy."
1,"Charging slot is not good, and Charging time require 5 hrs."
1,There is a white dot in that laptop and power button not responding it seems that low quality . check the white dot while playing a youtube video also . Please check the laptop properly
5,"After going through all the previous comments that this laptops have not been able to work properly, but trust me guys, its better to go for this unit. You can get this Spexs in this price.The Speed is really great, wether you are a working professional or an student.Display and Sound is impressive üî•üî•Had played AOE DE 2 and 3, CS Global, Pubg Lite, GtaV & Pes. Everything works.üî•üî•Go for it. Very Slim. This is as exact as MacbooküòÉüòÉ"
4,"it was amazing laptop with lightening speed, don't hesitate to buy, they are providing amazing features than any laptop else and also coming with 2 year warranty. iam using it for almost 1 month but its really working good and looks amazing, so far hundreds of people asked to the prize and other features, they are amazed the features that are providing at this prize. so i suggest you to buy if your are expecting everyday and multitasking laptop. it is one of the best at this range. battery life also very decent (7-8 hrs) for moderate use. it was one of the masterpiece for students."
1,"The product is not at all of any good quality. The customer service and after-sales service are pathetic and they do not provide ANY support. There are extremely less service centers, that too only in major metro cities, and the service provided is pathetic and they are extremely rude.  We regret the purchase of this laptop, and many issues creep up over a period of time. My touchpad stopped working in a month itself, software issues, driver errors, etc. When they try to fix the touchpad issue, after weeks of follow-up, sensor and blue tooth issues came up. We are still trying to follow up with them to fix this issue but there is no satisfactory answers or solutions is provided till now.Would never recommend it as it is a huge hassle for the consumer after the purchase. PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THIS PRODUCT and waste your time, energy, and Money. ""Selling inferior quality without any customer suppot"" Please be aware and Amazon should blacklist such company."
5,Laptop's performance & quality is very good but Amazon services are too bad first time i got laptop with dent in replacement got damaged laptop... Totally worst services... And all customer care representative give different different answers... After answering they don't accept that they spoke those words... I suggest never buy costly products from Amazon.... üôÇ
4,I am writing this review after using 5 days.Everything is perfect except following.1. Camera is 1M so not clear as other laptop.2. Battery is running out after 4 hrs in normal usage3. To get full charge it is taking 4-5hrs as it not c-type charger4. Battery Charging pin is too loose so you have to be careful during charging.
1,"i faced the troubles1 - replaced in 7 days by amazon - fault speaker and battery issue2 - 1st complaints jan21 - battery replace but fault not solved and new fault keyboard not work3 - 2nd complaints  feb21- keyboard replace - after 1 day facing fitting issue and battery issue same4 - in future, march 21 they will be change  system motherboard -don't go with youtube reviews...in my view -- you have to buy another brand laptops such as dell or hp or asus"
4,Good gaming laptop in 63k range. Boots up very fast. Laptop is very fast. Screen looks awesome. Go for it
1,I have received a used product for first time and then it got replaced with much older product than that so please don't buy products from lenovo unless you want to use someone used product
4,"Well, I had to replace my 6 yr old Mac book and since mac books were out of budget, had to look at windows.Was not keen to purchase a 15 inch as I wanted a compact laptop but no company was offering the same specs as these in a 60-70k price range in 13 inch category.The deal on Lenovo was excellent and I purchased it. Using it for nearly 2 months now.The best part is the specs especially it comes with a 4GB Nvidia graphics card.The speed is fast, doesn‚Äôt heat up, battery lasts for 4-5 hours and charges very fast.However, the only issue I face is with the mousepad  of the laptop.For some reason, the mousepad in 15 inch laptops is kept more towards the left. However, other companies give left & right click button on the mousepad, Lenovo doesn‚Äôt.This causes issues while browsing or copy and one has to look at the keypad to see where the left click or right click is.Otherwise no other issues."
3,"The laptop is fair for the price it come at. Allows for decent gaming performance at decent fps. Only mention to be made here is that the cooling fans are noisy & distracting all the time you play a game. Even during video calls the fans make some hype.The 3 stars are mainly for the Lenovo service. My laptop failed to start one day & I lodged a complaint with Lenovo on the 18th of August '21 (within warranty), I get a call back from the Lenovo team on the 21st of September '21 asking for details of the problem. When I asked the engineer why is he calling after more than a month, he stopped responding altogether & I had to disconnect the call after sometime."
2,Product is not to the mark. Battery was draining quickly and speakers were growling
5,"Added: total 16 GB RAM, 1TB HDD besides 500GB SSD , removed Mcafee, using norton.Likes : performane, no lagging even in games. Battery charging control. Data transfer rates.Dislikes: 2D performance rating, battery life is 3 to 4 Hrs only(no gaming). In windows 11 must need 16 GB as 8GB ram will always be full. Display brightness is less ealier i was using my laptop in 20 to 30% (lenovo z560) brightness now have to use at 60 to 80% brightness."
1,The is laptop is absolutely the worst with very weak processor . I bought it in haste and didn't think clearly while purchasing it. It's a train wreck cannot handle heavy tasks and gaming etc. It has a clear thermal management issue and thermal throttle all the time. It simply reaches 99¬∞C for simple gaming for five minutes. That's it its a disaster purchase go for ryzen any gen but not intel. These chips cannot even beat the ryzen 2-3 rd gen chips in any possible grounds
5,Laptoo boots so fast. Looks nice and sturdy. Runs fast. Gets hot when gaming other wise for normal processing it doesn't get hot.But the battery drains too quickly. Almost to the point it is useless.
2,"I recently bought the product, and the display was too bad. I already have another Lenovo laptop, but the new one which I bought has a yellowish display. Did the nightlight OFF, colour management, and several other fixes. But no luck. Can anyone help on this regard, please"
5,"Initial impressions are good. Overall performance is good with this price range. Battery lasts for around 2-3hrs in full performance mode and for normal use, it lasts for around 4+ hrs. Design is good and can blend in as office laptop."
4,Good
5,The product is good for gaming but speaker sounds during game is low so attach external speakers to it for loud üîä gaming rest all with this laptop is amazing also u can expect windows 11 home update in this laptop in October
4,Am worried about the excessive heating up ofsystem while gaming :
4,It's a best deal in comparison to market. Quality is also not compromise. Good value for money..
4,"Gaming-very good,screen - excellent, camera worst.,day to day usage-smooth.battery-average.."
3,The sound ouput is not at all meetingthe expectations. Speaker quality not suitable for online meetings or entertainment.
5,I like it too much and laptop is too much good at a price range
2,"it's just been 2 months, but laptop is getting over heated"
5,Value for money üí∞üí∞ Except for Battery life üîã.
5,Really nice for gaming
5,As mentioned the laptop is working great.
4,"Bought this laptop DV0543TU during GreatIndianSale-2021 at 54k(including bank offers). Apart from bank offer, I also got free PRIME membership for 1 yr and Audible membership for 6 months bundled with this laptopü§©. Used this laptop for 1 week and below is detailed review üë®‚ÄçüíªPROS üëç- Expandable option available for SSD and RAM. 476 GB of available SSD memory.- Build & Looks are awesome. Very thin & sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance- Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) & same way it shuts down. Applications starts/loads fast- Applications like Python, PyCharm,Photoshop etc loads quickly and runs efficiently without any hiccups- Speakers are also loud, although bottom firing- Microsoft integration is seamless, hence setup is quick.- USB Type-C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. You can also charge from Type-C port.- Battery last average around 5-6 hours (however depends upon usage patterns)CONS üëé- Charging pin, USB slots is too tight to push & pull out- Does not have SD card slot or fingerprint reader, images shown in AMAZON doesn't have correct images.- No camera shutter/privacy button- If HP doesn't bundle bag, they should atleast provide a carry case or sleeveüö© Keeping aside the cons, the HP Pavilion DV0543TU with (8GB/512GB/i5-11) can be ideal machine for buyers looking for a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty price. It's like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY premium laptop without compromising on processing power üíª !!!"
3,"The product worked fine for the first five days from delivery, then when I performed HP Hardware diagnosis, the keyboard test was a failure, then I contacted HP customer service technical team and he also checked my PC remotely and certified that one of the ALT key and the CTRL keys were shorted. Then I contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement, but they told that ""the seller has changed and the price has increased by Rs 3000, so can give only a return and not replacement"". So I returned the product. I think that the one which I received had a manufacturing defectiveness and it's all about how lucky you are to receive a good piece."
1,"Bought the hp laptop paying extra bucks over brands like1. Acer2. Asus3. Even Dell due to brand reliability and my good experience with hp in the past (just because the hardware from hp was reliable compared to other brands).But to my surprise, the hardware itself gave me problem so early (within 15 days of purchasing the laptop!!!). Don't know which brands to trust other than apple in this electronics industry where every company designs their products to fail in shortest possible time these days (probably intentional actions taken by all companies together just to keep their sales intact or even show growth in their sales!!!). Don't buy these laptops because they are slightly cheaper than apple. These are pretty inefficient companies manufacturing third grade products and that's why these are cheap compared to apple. You can also install windows on mac if required.. My mistake to go with hp which I'll not make in the future again!!!"
1,"very poor plastic screen, not durable body90% possible to broken during use.In my case already broken screen by little presure by mistake. Now replacement cost 16000 Rs.See any other brand, Hp warranty only cover hardware as per local services center. ( Too bed behaviour of service exicutive )Never recommend HP go other like Dell, Mac"
4,"Laptop is good, I got 8gb version which is performing well. Got windows 11 upgrade immediately.Cons:Heating issue.Limited portsKeyboard keys could have been better.Build quality is not up to the mark. Plastic has not properly futon with the frame. Gaps seen"
4,The laptop is super light and pretty thin. My dad received the parcel and thought it had nothing inside and callee back the delivery person before opening it. It is that light. So automatically raises questions on its durability as it's not a all metal body either. The set-up was easy and there is nothing to complain about.
5,Very fast computer. No issue so far. Battery backup very good 5/6 hours. I use for normal day to day work no game.keyboard backlit and very strong.
1,Motherboard is not working with in a week

1,Laptop getting hang very much and very much slow start.This is happening within 2 days of purchase
3,It looks the screen size is small . Its not look 15.6 inch. Can some one help me
5,Runs smoothly after OS update....very light weight and compact...hp assistant very useful and simple........
5,"Was worried about speed issues that many had complained in the reviews. But still went ahead with the purchase. After powering on there is quite a few updates that will happen. At that time i found it to be slow(background downloads and installations will happen) Go to updates and ensure that there are no pending updates. Once all the updates are applied, the laptop is perfectly fine. My kid is using for schools and other assignment. If you are using a browser + MS office applications +zoom(or other vide chat apps), there is absolutely no problem with this laptop. it is absolutely fine. Not sure about gaming though"
2,"Lookwise & bodywise ok. But it is too slow and hangs a lot, dont buy it..."
1,"I had purchased this laptop, and got it with faulty one, immediately replaced it and got one more with display faulty. Put my laptop into refund, and these amazon people made me run behind them so much and nearly 2 weeks after they took laptop from me, and they still didnt initiate the refund.worst experience for the first time with amazon.Please dont buy htis and waste ur time as well as ur money.Amazon has falled down for me now."
1,"The product was defective and it took a couple of months to just initiate a return . Calling the customer support for help took a while . The technicians didn‚Äôt turn up at all. The person who came to take the return item didn‚Äôt have patience to turn on the laptop and check the serial number and did not pick up the item . The second time after initiating the return I just received a message that said couldn‚Äôt pick up the item from customer . I‚Äôm always home , no calls from Amazon but just received a message that the item could not be picked up . I had a lesson that valuable items should not be ordered online ."
3,Suggesting to go for SSD instead of hdr as it tooks a solid 40 seconds for booting which is very annoying.
4,Value for money laptop from an branded manufacturer.
1,"The product is worst. It is a 11th gen i3 processor, but the performance is dead slow. The display is faulty. Lot of white spots on the display when the screen is black. Poor customer service from Amazon. Still waiting for service arranged by Amazon. They sell faulty electronic items and do not allow refund to return. Who need a replacement faulty device? Bad experience"
5,"Good laptop under budget with all specifiction required.Little slow while starting, rest behaving good while working.Plastic quality of laptop disappointed this could be better."
1,"I ordered it during sale at 41K . Unfortunately could not returned it during return window.Its not at all worth the price. It's terribly slow. Don't go by the configuration.I am a Dell and Apple fan, bought HP first time. My 7 year old Dell laptop has much more faster performance and good built. It was bought at same range 40KOnly good things about this one are loud & clear sound quality and its light weight.All other things bad.Would not recommend it."
4,Good product .Have decent speed for daily use .The keypad buttons are big enough and feels good .The storage space is more than sufficient .The genuine windows 10 and ms office package come with it .It's light weight and easy to carry.However on flop side the key board is made of plastic whivh could have been better.do not come with licensed anti virus device.The ram speed could have been better and the I3 processor could have been upgraded. Over all it'd decent product for its purchase cost.
2,"I just got this yesterday and it took close to 4 hours to get it setup. Even after spending that much time, here are some issues still bothering me.1. No proper instructions or warranty information present.2. MS Office was not present. Had to contact HP support to install it..but it still doesnt work. It asks for activation key.3. Microphone quality is very poor. The person on the other side cannot hear me properly.4. When i connect the headphones, they are not detected.5. System is very very slow (probably because of all the software getting updated). But even after 12 hours it is slow so can't exactly blame software update.6. The plastic and overall quality looks cheap.7. No number lock indicator.8. Fan is too noisy and CPU/Memory/Disk one of it is always close to 100%.So i am thinking of returning this if the issues are not resolved in a day or two."
5,"Although it is too early to provide a feedback with only two days of use however I am providing this feedback because the experience is too good till now. Few additional features can add more user friendly experience like it doesn't contains keyboard background light. Also, the first time when you open the laptop, it started taking update from Microsoft. So connect with a good LAN or Wi-Fi and be patient to install the update."
1,Please don't west your money3months I'm buying the productEvery 5days I'm going to hp service centerHe's clean the ram and hard diskRunning performance very very very slowly
4,"Reading good comments here, bought this. Been using this since 3 days, and I see slowness, installed only chrome. Chrome doesnt open fast, had to do some diagnostics to improve performance (marginal). I have now scheduled a technician visit, if that doesnt solve, I'm returning.After writing this review, I see good performance :) not sure what changed. I believe, the OS was downloading stuff and optimising. Have been using this since a week now and no complaints"
5,"I am using since 2 months,  its very eay to use, easy to install all applications. I booked installation service which helped me divide the hard disk into 3 allocations. Windows and Microsoft Office are lifetime valid. I also use for multiple software applications, rarely lags."
2,After two month of use I am writing this review.please dont Buy is laptop as it is very very slow. It takes too much time to start also. As I am not using any antivirus software than also speed is very poor.
3,"Construction quality is not good... Intial start take linger after that ok. Hinges are not smooth and rigid, battery life is not impressive. For students ok.. Or first laptop users not find differences."
4,I likeProcessor speed display all connectivity fast charging battery backup upto 5 hours lightweight slim design overall good packageDislikePlastic type body design matte finish colour feel like low quality material and last the power button not feeling so good
1,I recieved laptop after  5 th days. IIS not working I showen in hp show he as given me doan letter it is not
2,"I bought this Laptop considering HP name. However,  this Laptop is disappointing. Using for 3 months now. first,  it is extremely slow. takes lot of time to startup. Second, it gives problem in running exam software which usually runs on other Laptops. When i click on hardware diagnostic,  it goes into restart mode and doesn't come up. i had to shut down restart atleast 10 times and then it came up. Better to get laptop from US, Singapore if you know someone for good quality."
4,Go for it when you are looking for a HP laptop having reasonable configuration.
5,Always before HP always keep its standard.Its very nice to use and light weight.HD screen is too good and sound clarity also very nice.Delivery from Amazon prime also very speed.I got the product on the 3rd day from I ordered.Thanks for Amazon and HP
5,"Pros:Build quality - feels premium.Display quality - ips display with excellent viewing angles.Battery life - easily gives 7-8 hours and charges within 1:20 hours.Sound: loud and clear with Harman Audio.Performance: boots up quickly and performs very well for general usage.No deal breakers as such but would be tempted forBrightness: although it's sufficient but another 20-30 nits would be awesome.MS Office: at the price they could have bundled it with office home and student.RAM: at the price 8 GB of RAM should be there. Can be increased, but existing ram would be useless as there is judt one slot.Overall really happy with the purchase and would certainly recommend this at this price."
4,"1. Laptop looks good at this price, purchased 2 days ago.2. Keyboard is not backlit. But it is wrongly mentioned under product description that Keyboard is backlit."
5,"PROs:the laptop boots fast, apps open fast. very snappy.laptop build is quality is good. though not as premium as thinkpad t series.you get sata drive, you can connect HDD or sata SSD to expand storage.the concern i had before buying the laptop was how well it could run linux. It runs linux very well. tried ubuntu 20.04LTS. on linux battery backup is very good and does not heat during normal usage.con:there is only one ram slot. if you plan to upgrade ram, you will have to remove existing ram and keep aside.no keyboard backlightthe warranty had started two months back when in checked lenovo vantage. there is optionnin lenovo website to correct it. mine is corrected now"
4,"This laptop has amazing build quality for the price.Everything feels solid and well put togather.The Ips Display,Though not that color accurate has really wide viewing angles.The Looks are also really good.The laptop can handle basic tasks very well with the default configuration.The NVME SSD makes the laptop boot up and open apps really quickly.The laptops feels really snappy overall due to the ssd.  The only dowlside is the 4gb single channel ram.I'm planning to upgrade it to 8 gb ram since the ram starts to get filled up to 90% if i open 5-10 tabs in firefox"
2,The laptop is heavy.The display is not good. compared display with other ThinkPad machine.rest config is average as per the price.
5,"I use it for normal home use,  Like watching movies , light browsing. Can watch 2 movies continuously once full charge. Light weight, compact and sturdy feel."
5,The only cons of this laptop is RAM is not upgradable. Either you should use it with the given size or completely replace the existing one.
5,"Go for i5 , i3 is bit slow . Fast Charging is good though . I‚Äôm enjoying it for now"
5,"Thinkpad E14 is a very nice product. It comes with 256 GB SSD which gives a good performance. It came in a good packing, new piece without any issue. Cost is worth to spend."
4,"Thinkpad is the best. As far as this model is concerned, it's good for it's price. If you upgrade the RAM to 8GB, it works like a charm."
5,My Lenovo think pad best in ever unbeatable last seven yearsDurable and performanceAmazing 3 hours battery backupMy favorite
1,"I had bought this product on 6th July, 2021 and I am writing this on 8th September, 2021. So I believe I can give a comprehensive usage summary.To begin with, I received a defective product, the earphone socket was not working and the earphones/headphones were not getting detected!!I replaced it within one week and got a new one, which again had the same problem!!Now I contacted DELL, and the kind of help that I received from them is just PATHETIC!!All they would ask is to update the drivers, and this continued for 2months, after which they sent a mechanic yesterday.He couldn't understand the source of the problem, and blindly changed the motherboard. Now my system has got slower, but the issue still PERSISTS!!Whenever I contact DELL, they still ask me to update the drivers.I have suffered a lot with this product, and the DELL customer service.I do not want any one of you to go through this!! Please make your choices sensibly, after a thorough research, don't commit the same mistake like me. I blindly went forward with DELL, thinking about the brand name only..."
5,Compact light weight laptop.Good battery performance.Screen is full HD display and could have been more better.Sound is low.Overall nice package in this cost by Dell.
5,"Hi All, After a continuous struggle for 7 days I finally fixed to this model. Believe me it is the best and was fitting to all my requirements.1) Latest processor2) Helpful for mid range tasks, browsing,coding, entertainment3) FHD display4) 8 GB ram , expandable to 16 gb5) 512 GB SSD  --> it makes booting really quick6 ) battery 6 hours7) Good sound quality8) Dell has good after sale support9 ) Nice build quality10) All necessary ports and RJ45 port as well. SD card reader11)Backlit keyboardGo for it.. you will be satisfied with the purchase"
1,"dont'buy this laptop, there is no backlit keyboard. If u ask them they will blame dell and dell people will blame amazon. The laptop is defective one and product was already registered on someone else name on17th sept, although i ordered it on 2nd oct. Its is a big scam, nothing is working in laptop"
1,Worst product...not expected like this.
1,I had a very bad experience purchasing this laptop. It had sound issue and screen flickering issue. I will not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Bought a Dell Vostro 3400 on 2nd Nov 2001 from Amazon! In a couple of weeks had Audio/Speaker/Microphone issues. Lodged a service request on 25th Nov 2021 with Dell Technical Support and still today i.e 16th Dec 2021 my issues remained unresolved !! Amazon couldn't give any support in this regard. A photo of 29th Nov is attached. Don't buy Dell laptops as they have horrible after sales service !!
3,It heats up fast
1,Waste product. Starts complaint within one week. Amazon replaced the product and new product also full of complaints. Irresponsible customer service. They never solve your problem. Complaint coming in each weeks. Waste of money. Go for other companies. Don't buy Dell products. Rating:0
1,"Product having sound issues, service is no much delay , pls don't buy , Amazon also not care , just after two months of bought this laptop , slowly device start not working"
4,Good
1,1 poor battery performanc.2 heating problem 3.too much noise in fan. 4 zoom screen mirroring not workin.4 very poor dell support
1,"Faced issue with speaker within 10 days of purchase. Company changed speaker, followed by motherboard, still issue remains unsolved. Worst post sales services."
4,"It is faster and more responsive than any other laptop I have worked on.Why 4 stars? Because when I started using it, it killed my WiFi Router every time I tried to connect to the internet. All the devices connected to that router would loose internet connection if I connected this laptop.Extensive research on the internet revealed that the Windows based pre-installed Lenovo apps like Lenovo Vantage may be responsible for the issue.I uninstalled all pre-installed Lenovo apps and the issue is now resolved. Posting this in the hope that it may help others."
5,"This is a laptop that I purchased after extensive research and hundreds of hours of watching YT reviews on the latest laptops. I wanted something that was future proof for at least the next 7 years but light on my pocket.I did not want fancy good looking thin and light laptops with fancy features like windows hello face recognition, 24-hour battery life, Thunderbolt 4. These are good features to have but I did not want them on my laptop. The main purpose of this laptop was school work, light programming, consuming entertainment and seamless web browsing. Particularly, I wanted the office applications to open quickly and get work done soon, instead of waiting for them to load forever.This laptop delivered everything I wanted. It is a no-nonsense laptop. Performs exactly as I expected. The application opening is snappy. The response times for web browsing are super crisp. Installations take barely any time. The web download and upload speeds are impressive. Some pros and cons for your consideration below.Pros:-Built like a tank, sturdy, no flex on screen, the body is hard with minimal keyboard flex-Typing experience is good with good keys layout, awesome special keys at the top row-Trackpad is large enough and very responsive, buttery smooth pinch-zoom just like a mac-Screen is large with barely any bezels (just about 1 cm chin)-The top lid is metal and feels premium (attracts fingerprints though)-Processor and ram performance are on point-The wifi connection stability is consistent and has high speed-Applications open swiftly and boot time is within 7 seconds-Fingerprint sensor has <1 second response time (the best I have seen)-Hinge is plastic but sturdy and it will last long-Screen brightness is good, suited for my purpose-Seamless integration into a wireless display-Lenovo vantage software keeps things updated and allows easy management of the laptop-MS office setup was easy-McAfee Full version cost just 299 extra-Type C USB port for display or power deliveryCons-Webcam is poor (you may want to use an external camera, no windows hello face recognition)-Screen resolution could have been better-Sound is loud but has a tin like quality as if coming from a hollow. The sound is sufficient for casual use/online class but you may want to use a earphone anyways-Slightly heavier (can lift with one hand), probably due to the build quality-Botton cover is plastic (but a high-quality one with no plasticky feeling), feels rubberised surface-No dedicated GPU like MX450 in this model (other variations of this laptop have GPU but they do not have 16GB ram)-Battery lasts for 7 hours or less on regular surfing (a 70Whr battery would have been nicer instead of the 57 Whr)-Charger is small but the conventional type. Instead, I would have liked a single brick USB type C charger (like the mac).Final recommendation: This is the laptop for everyday use for everyone, where you don't have to worry about being careful with it (like a mac). It will take care of you. The Cons mentioned above are minor quibbles from a perfectionist but to be balanced in my review I had to point them out.Get work done without the distraction of fancy features. Will recommend this laptop for price-conscious power users who just want some peace of mind with their laptop and work. Get the three years warranty for extra peace."
4,"I have purchased it for 77K. Specifications are good like 512GB SSD,16 GB RAM,8GB graphics card, i7 11th generation laptop under this price is good. Power backup is good for 7 hours ofdaily use not for gamers. This is the review of 6 months of use.I haven't get any WiFi connectivity issues for first 3 weeks later WiFi connectivity issues are started.Freuently disconnecting the WiFi. Also frequently refreshing the browser and desktop. System is getting restarted frequently,so I have reset the OS after that it is working as expected so rating has increased from 3 to 4. Speakers are working fine, sound quality is fabulous.Display is also good.I will strongly recommend this laptop for every one including gamers.I will edit this review frequently to help others."
3,"Guys they said office 2019 is available and pre installed. I found it that 365 trial version is installed and it ask for paid activation as per MS policy. There is complete mismatch. I tried to call lenovo care they asked me uninstall this 365 trial and gave some link to download the 2019 office. I did that and created new MS email account but still it is not activating.Laptop is good ..some missing things that the mouse has only one set of right and left key, it is fast and booting also quickly.PS worked with Lenovo premium support and raised rickets now office activated. Got Win 11"
5,"Sharing views after 1 week of laptop usage.Pros:1. Intel i5/16 GB RAM with shared IRIS graphics in just Rs. 60k.2. Privacy shutter for cam.3. Sturdy body with good elevation for ventilation.4. Full access to MS Office 2019 home/student edition and free upgrade to Windows 11.5. No bloatware that slowdown PC.6. Lenovo Vantage point to control some BIOS features from Windows.Cons:1. Only 2 USBs ports, as I am used to having 3 USB ports in my old Dell laptop.2. Screen brightness control is very limited. Either it is too bright or too dark and not getting proper setting."
4,"The overall laptop is good and working smoothPros:The fingerprint sensor is awesomeBattery backup is as decent, While doing development on vscode I found it near where 5-6 hours.screen brightness is good and keyboard backlit comes with 2 mode of lightsSlim easy to carryPerfomance is excellent no lag so farDoing development on vs code working on multiple tabs and also other software are running parralelyCons:Charger gets heated after 1 hourKeyboard is little conjusted as it is 15inch laptop and not 15.6 inchCamera quality is not up to the markbody is ok okIf u want to take laptop for professional use u can definitely go for it.This is the best choice"
5,i love the laptop and the perfomance it does is just awesome and another interestihing is it has windows 11 for free and just looking great the intel i5 processor does the job for you just forget the negative comments and go for it  only one thing it does not have face unlock may be for this price range tthis is little minus point
5,"Performance is good for office and personal usage.However Hard-disk space is just 512GB.I used multiple Virtual Machines, and that was smooth.Games with very high graphics requirements has significant lag. I tried to play Call of Duty, but it was not as smooth as expected."
4,"Namaste, dear Sir/Ma‚ÄôamI have happily purchased a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Laptop from you. Unfortunately after transferring the data from an old laptop, i found that the capacity of storage on this laptop is 512GB SSD only and excluding the expected 1TB HDD.512 GB SSD is not enough of a storage capacity for my use.Also, Initially I was looking for i7 Processor and this Laptop is i5.Therefore, if possible, I would like to exchange with another laptop that you offer and, of course, pay for the difference in price.The Laptop and Specs i look for are:CPU - i7 ProcessorStorage - 1TB HDD + 500 GB SSDRAM - 16GBSize - 15.6‚ÄùKind regards and  thanks you for your help."
5,"Feature loaded for Business Purpose. Used for a week now and all laptop system is fine till date. Activation of MS office was also smooth. Getting use to new keyboard will take some time. I feel Window Pro option, should also be available, even if Lenovo might charge a small premium for the same. Laptop boots really fast due to SSD and all applications opens promptly as compared to my old dell i7 laptop. New laptop means good battery life, but need to see how it performs after couple of years of use."
5,"Bought this for 59500 under my credit card offer,I have been using this laptop for a month now, it hasPros: good battery backup, quick charging, ultimate portability, lightning fast operations.Cons:1. Slightly warms up when charged/using while charging ( can be overlooked if u black an elevation at the backend allowing air to pass)2. Fingerprint sensor ( sometimes it doesn't respond, a bigger round fingerprint sensor would be good )Overall it is a great laptop to have with the facilities provided,I got the 512gb ssd, it has available space of 430gb and the bad thing about it is that It has only one drive, so the windows files will be there, I created a new folder and shifted them and hid them, it would have been better if I had recieve atleast 2 partition on the SSD.Performance wise it is great, if you are a student/professional you should go for it.Worth the value."
5,It is fast and works perfectly fine.Little bit heavy to my liking though.
2,It took me one month to get my laptop working to my requirement.. the laptop comes with only student n home MS office so outlook and other apps needed for business is to be bought and it is expensive.. secondly not many Lenovo shops to help configure the laptop everyone in and around services out of warranty laptops only.. it's a huge draw back.. I wish u had choosen Dell instead..
2,"You can buy the same for better price directly in lenovo site than here. Was mentioned as Limited time deal but later realised the price is cheaper in Lenovo site and Tatacliq.In Lenovo the 2021 model of same specification is much cheaper.With 1mp camera, the video quality is very poor. Didn't expect such thing from Amazon where mentioned as Limited Time Deal and price is still comparatively higher."
5,"I love everything about this machine. Using from past 1 month and no complaints so far. It has awesome audio, display, and video quality. Do not go by negative reviews. I am a software developer and research everything before buying this.Save your time and trust me. This is the best at this price"
5,"Got this power-packed laptop with i7-11th Gen under the hood. 16 GB RAM and SSD has really added to the performance. Would definitely recommend to anyone whose a developer, business person, student or someone whose just looking to have a smooth day to day experience working on a laptop."
1,"WiFi connectivity issues are started.Frequently disconnecting the WiFi. Also frequently refreshing the browser and desktop. Unable to upgrade to win11 because of wifi connection. Tried the mentioned solution steps (restarted router, rested the pc, updated the drivers) in lenovo page for thus issue still no luck. Not at all worth buying this laptop.Seeking for help from amazon technician no one has turned up for this."
5,"Nice product,Best Performance Laptop Even tested The graphics is awesome and ssd is there so no issues in Speed.Loving ittttttt.."
5,light for office use and fast for gaming ideal laptop.
5,Was bit skeptical about buying laptop through Amazon but to my surprise it came in perfect condition and better priced than local stores. Thanks Amazon for your services
5,"I searched several laptops around 60k budget but finally I found lenovo IdeaPad slim 5 with finest features. It's having finger print sensor, back lit led keyboard, intel i5 11th gen processor,16gb RAM, 512gb SSD, Life time OS and MS office. Good laptop for students or office usage. Only web cam quality should be improved. Ovarall I'm fully satisfied with the laptop features and it's performance."
5,This laptop was amazing and good performance and good battery backup overall performance was good..Recommended to students price range between 70k-80k
4,This product is good build quality and looks premium. I have purchased 16gb RAM and 512 gb SSD (device has 475GB only not 512GB) in that free storage is ~440GB . But sometimes perfomance is getting slow in normal usage only. Sound quality and display good.
4,There might be a problem with the screen or the driver. All of a sudden the text on the screen starts to shake. This has happened twice now. Also the screen goes black some times when the popped up window in Edge takes time to load.
3,"I am using this product for business purposes. Am not happy with the mouse pad as it is too large. Also, overall keypad layout is not very intuitive."
2,Overall Product... upgraded windows 11 and faced flickering issues and resolved by Levono
5,"It is fast, design is good, almost all features of modern laptop. Slim but bit heavy"
5,Awesome performance.
2,Theres a scratch already in the screen and product not as expectedalso no freebies or anything with such a big amount purchase.
5,"Laptop is crisp and clean. Finger print scanner works like charm. Camera and sound quality are excellent, handles Gameing pretty decent for this prize range."
4,"Value of money. The miccould have been better. That's the reason for giving 4 stars. Else,nice laptop"
5,Lenovo is awesome üëç üòéüòéüòéüòé
5,This is so far good. No issues at all. Very good product as well by looking at the value that is paid. Good ROI.
5,Product was expected. Performance of the PC is very good daily updates and checks are feasible as using original OS and Software
5,"Good intelligent equipment, high tech feel."
4,overall its good laptop.Its little heavy but good laptop.
1,"Bought the Mi Ultra laptop during the first sale on 31st Aug. Extremely disappointed with the laptop as well as Mi Support.12/09: Laptop doesn't turn on anymore. It has been 10 days, so cannot even return it. On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!Update 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!Update 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!Just lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky. Else, I would have got a repaired one.Anyway, I'm happy I got a new replacement laptop and currently it's working well."
5,"Pros:1) Build quality.2) Display (best I have ever seen amongst laptops).3) Keyboard, great typing experience.4) Fingerprint, lightening fast.Cons:1) Sound speakers downwards, would have been better on surface. Unfortunately, I have never seen good speakers in mid range laptop. Mac speakers are definitely good, but with a price tag.Overall: Value for money.Yet to test:1) Battery.2) Performance."
1,"Overall product is good, but charger is missing in package, and web cam is very bad quality"
5,"Thanks to livetre.com who's reviewing this laptop right now. Like many already pointed out the volume is very low when you get the laptop and also the keyboard backlight goes off after every 15 sec if not touched.? But there's a fixIn the windows start search 'dts' and open the app called dts audio processing and choose the Game Mode t0 get loud sound.And for the keyboard backlight to get always on, Restart and press F2 to enter in to bios. look for keyboard backlight power and set to standard mode instead of power save mode for backlight.only downside of this laptop is the trackpad click. Due to large trackpad the clicks feels stiff and weird."
5,"No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price. Would have loved the ryzen variants that were launched in China to be launched here but either way it's still a steal for a deal like this. The only issue is if they provided another fan, instead of a single fan system would have been good cuz I live in a very hot area. The temps go high as 98¬∞ for 1-2 seconds during a very high load and then goes down at 75¬∞ immediately after the fan kicks in. Noise of the fan is not noticeable even at high speed. Overall a bank for the buck. Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.Low sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop."
5,"I just received this laptop earlier today. Got it on the first flash sale. I bought the highest specifications available at 16GB RAM, I7 Processor. So far I have some observations to share. I am categorizing them below for your reference.Pros:1. Exceptional build quality. This one unlike its predecessor feels very premium. Of course, it has a very heavy influence from MacBook design. But I won't complain. I love the build of this machine2. Beautiful display. No other laptops give you this high-resolution matt finish display. The 3K display at this price point is just nuts. Not only does it make consuming multimedia an enjoyable experience, but being productive using Microsoft apps and other apps is very good too thanks to the 3:2 aspect ratio. WFH is a breeze if you work on a lot of spreadsheets as this aspect ratio helps in showing more rows and columns on the display and the high resolution helps in clarity on what you see on screen. An absolute win here for the laptop. Also, scrolling on this screen is super smooth thanks to the 90 Hz refresh rate3. Great Keys and trackpad area: The butterfly keys are so good to type on and the large precision trackpad is a joy4. 16GB RAM, 512GB NVME SSD &  i7 Processor: Apps launch quick thanks to fast NVME SSD. You can have multiple chrome tabs and other apps open thanks to 16GB RAM. Remember, this device is not meant for hardcore gamers. This laptop is meant for users who use the device for a lot of office work that needs high processing power. Example: If you work on a lot of spreadsheets, code, a lot of chrome tabs, work on databases, etc. This is what the laptop is for. Tasks that require high processing power are what you get. Of course, you can game on it, but light ones at best. Also, not everyone is a YouTubers or a graphics designer. YouTubers only focus on video editing apps, photoshop, etc. But productivity means a hell of lot more than this laptop does without dropping a sweat :)5. Great port selection: You get a couple of USB C ports and a thunderbolt port for connecting external devices6. Fast fingerprint reader with windows hello feature!Cons:1. Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre. It is good for video calls and office calls and maybe watching a video or 2. But not more than that. The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny. Recommeded to use any earphones or headphones to consume media (3.5 mm jack has good audio output)2. Keyboard layout: This might be a personal preference, but I find the Home, End, Pg Up & Dn keys on the right corner of the keyboard to be confusing. I have already hit the Pg UP key multiple times instead of the Enter key and the same is the case with the Home button instead of the Delete key3. The trackpad clicks: Although the gestures work great and the smooth navigation of the trackpad is good, the clicks kind of feels weird. It sounds plasticy and those click sounds can be annoying to someOverall recommending this laptop for anyone who wants a great home laptop with no compromise of WFH setup as well as consumes a lot of media. Kudos to Xiaomi for bringing such a great device to India."
1,"Got it delivered today, the build quality is great, display is amazing. Performance is also good.Only disappoinment is with sound. It is very low, even ur mobile sound could be louder then this. Xiaomi should definitely work on this."
5,"Looks great, super display and  quite fast so far.Big disspointment is the charger and charging. It has the ugliest legacy looking charger i have seen in recent times.. and no we can't use any usb type c charger to charge the laptop. This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.The webcam and the speakers are also totally useless. So a video call was a disspointing experience.And the free office for home and student didn't get activated for me. All mi support could do was redirect me to a youtube video and microsoft directly. I wasn't able to work around the error msg: office home and student is not associated to your account. Hope it works for others.Happy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.Rest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options."
5,"ProsGreat price to value proposition. Similar spec laptops cost twice as much from established brands.Beautiful 15.6 inch anti glare 16:10 aspect ratio matte screen. 16:10 ratio helps to see more lines in excel/word documents compared to 16:9 aspect ratio. But 16:9 seems more suited for viewing videos since no horizontal black bars at the top and bottom of screen.Elegant looks in full metallic body. Grey colour variant looks stunning. Like an affordable windows macbook. Solid built with no flex in the laptop body.Thunderbolt 4 port for versatile connectivity. Connect 2 4k monitors simultaneously from same thunderbolt port. Thunderbolt is exclusive to 11th gen Intel core i5/i7 and not available yet in AMD ryzen 7 series processors.Charge through either thunderbolt port or type c portMacro key which can be used to quick launch an app like chrome by drag and drop of app into the macro key input area.Battery charge indicator with 3 colours. Red for  charge less than 20, orange from 20 to 90 and green for charge more than 90 percentage.90hz display with 3k resolution.

Configure touchpad options for better results.Good palm rejection and comfortable edges while typing on keyboard.Hinge closes in a smooth pleasant manner with enough cushioningHassle free exchange by Amazon for 7 year old base model macbook air.No cost emi for 3 monthsWhat could have been improved to make this laptop even better:Mi 67w sonic charger which has a slim profile should have been provided instead of the rather  uninspiring default legacy kind of looking LITEON company charger.Small size of shift key on right takes time to get used to. Could have been a normal size shift key.No dedicated sd card slot to quickly transfer photos from SLR to laptop. Have to rely on usb cables.No dedicated number keys even though laptop is a 15.6 inch one. Would have been better to have dedicated number keys while working on excel.Voice capture using inbuilt microphone not the loudest. Use a wired or wireless headphone for voice capture.A bit on heavier side while picking up.May be due to the grade 6 sandblasted aluminium used.Backlight doesn't stay on. Goes off after sometime of inactivity and has to be renabled. But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.Default sound output from speakers not loud enough. Only once games mode is selected and equalizer is enabled from inbuilt dts app does the sound output cross 80 decibel."
3,"You cannot buy Xiaomi extended warranty if you buy this laptop on Amazon. Spoils the overall buying experience. You will have to go for a third party insurance which costs much higher than Xiaomi offer.However Amazon provide exchange offer. So if you need warranty extension + exchange, go for Amazon, else buy this on Xiaomi website."
1,There is no charger in the box..... I tried to replace it..... But there is no. Response till now..... This time I'm very Dispoinnted by amazon....
3,The hinge cud be better.... U can only open to a certain angle maybe 130% unlike most other laptops which can go to 178%.... Battery is not for heavy use.... Additionally I didn't see any charging limiter so using while keeping on charge may degrade the battery.... Somehwat unlike other laptops... The default Blue light filter or night light is set in a strange colour science.. it's rather stressful to eyes...u basically can't use night light or blue light filter in day light... I use night light turned on 24X7..... In my acer swift 3 but here nahh the contrast is just too on the warmer side I guess.... Mi needs to send updates for the same...
1,"I got my laptop delivered today from Amazon. As I was looking for an extended warranty, I called mi.com and was asked to call oneassist to get the warranty. They offered extended two years warranty at 6499 while the same plan if purchased from mi.com along with the laptop is 3699.  I called mi customer care and the reason given was since you have purchased from Amazon, our partners can't provide you at the same rate and you should have bought from mi.com. Why is this not mentioned in Amazon or mi website as a disclaimer. I felt really cheated and this is not what I expected from Amazon nor Xiaomi"
1,"I received the laptop on 22 sep 2021. Its build is superb, display is by far the best. But on just the third day of usage the keyboard started to malfunction. Somehow the keyboard is behaving as if the shift keys are randomly presses. All trackpad functions first malfunctioning then all of a sudden it just stopped working. Now i am thinking that did i do any mistake in placing my trust in Xiaomi. Are they giving cheap quality hardware packed in a high quality build??? Hoping to see a quick resolution to my problem."
2,Video Player is loading.
5,"We'll crafted, light weight laptop with top notch internals. Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands ."
4,"Everything is fine i doesn't like 3 things in it they are1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it's not giving any premium feel and not nice.2) 2√ó2W Speakers are very low.3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named ""LITEON"" Brand.Rest of that everything is fine"
1,Pathetic quality.  Keyboard failed within a week.  Stay away from this and buy a good brand.
5,"If productivity is your main agenda in a windows package, then it really doesn't get better than this. The value this laptop provides is unmatched in the market , especially the display which is going to leave your breathless. This is pure windows in a good hardware package by Xiaomi. No bloatware and ads at all.Thoroughly happy with the purchase."
4,"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.I have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).However everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation."
5,Pros:Great display..Great speed...Great metallic design...Great performance....Highly responsive fingerprint scanner..Typing feels marvelous..Battery backup satisfactorily upto 3hrs.. (we cannot expect much at this price range)Cons:Numeric keypad is absent.Speakers are down facing... Hence you won't feel that much sound.Grill vents in the downside of the laptop are bendable which I quite personally hate so much.Overall:Wonderful product at this price range. Buy it without a second thought.
4,Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.I tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook üòÇPros -1) Metal build2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 portCons-1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wiresOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket. But there are some concerns about the after sale services..... Let's see it how it happens in upcoming days üòä
5,"I bought the product with configuration of i5, 16gb RAM, 512 SSD, and here is my review after the first day use:1) Display:Display of the laptop is excellent. I was looking for one with a good display that will help me work without the monitor connected.2) Battery:With a moderate use, battery performance on the first day was really good. I worked for nearly 5 hours (out of which 2 hrs of zoom calls) and 50% drained.3) Camera:Camera is just fine for video calls, not bad actually as it's used mainly for video conferences or online classes etc.4) Speakers:Inbuilt speakers are fine for the above mentioned uses. I felt it's more effective when it's kept on a surface than we keep it on lap.5) Performance:Performance wise there is not much notable difference from those of others with the same specification3) Others:Fingerprint, keyboard, mouse pad are also impressive in the first instance.My take: Overall a good, worthy and budget friendly product when compared to those in the same category!Thanks to Amazon too, to deliver it quickly and to give an option to buy for a day when the stock is up"
5,"The laptop has been proven to be a superior machine in terms of quality and performance despite a competitive price there has been some compromises to reduce the price such as absence of dedicated GPU, a card slotbut for a normal user like me it should not matter much so I'd give it a 4.5 stars a best buy itself, xiomi has created an ecosystem now and I've become a part of it"
4,"I bought this on 8th Sep. The laptop is good and definitely value for money.But there was no Mi extended warranty option when you buy from Amazon. I wrote to Amazon and the response was to contact in case I do not get any response by 17th. But on 18th the option of chat contact was also closed (return window closed on 17th, - I did not understand the connection as the question is not about return)nor did I get any response through email.  It is cheating as you pay the same price for curtailed benefits but you are not told of this upfront. This leaves bad tase in the whole buying experience. For the first time I am unhappy with both Amazon and Xiaomi."
5,"Pehli baat to is laptop ko buy karna hi Mahabharat hai.Not available anywhere in NCR region i5/16gb. Just imagine not available in capital city!!Luckily i got from Amazon which took 8 days to deliver since it wasn't on stock.About the laptop its beauty!! hats off to Xiaomi for this. As RAM is not upgradable, never buy 8gb version."
5,"The Laptop is the best in the price range.Pros- Performance, Build Quality, Display, Battery, TrackpadCons- Keyboard a little Flimsy with a little flexThe sound problem can be resolved by playing with the DTS Control Panel."
5,Good quality
1,Battery not working
1,Camera quality not good
1,Very insensitive and lazy. Don't buy AVITA laptops. My laptop is stuck with service centre for 4 months. Very very frustrated.
5,Need of students fullfillled by this laptop under budget. Best productive and budget friendly laptop. Its amazing laptop i have seen under this cost.

5,"To sum up my overall experience with the laptop, it has been good. Thanks to the Kapil Sir for making sure that it is delivered with at most customer satisfaction."
5,"Very Thin, light weight, fast boot, fast shut down. Longer battery life. You will love watching full HD or 4K videos on this display.As I used for 2 days, so yet to validate battery strength on regular basis. I will share battery review after 1 week.16GB Ram, L3 8MB, 6 core Ryzen 5, NVME, good finger print lock.Delivered next day by Amazon.Keyboard gives initial impact that keys letters/numbers could be bolder. But with continued use you may find it comfortable. I think silver background and light black text may gives illusion of thin text on keys. It might be due to my use of complete black body laptop with white text keys earlier. But not big deal.Software is Win Home provided. Anti virus provided is McAfee which is one month free version. It could have been 1 year. Dropbox 12 month provided free, it could have been 1 month instead of McAfee. MS Office provided is desktop version. Office 365 is not included.I will recommend better you order laptop cushion cover and keyboard cover with this. This generation laptops are very delicate not sterdy as like before"
1,"After just use of 4 days of this laptop, the AMD high definition audio drivers suddenly stopped working and there was no sound output not even from any earphones or headset. So I contacted hp support, they did all the troubleshooting and the sound came back but now there is Realtek(HD) drivers and not AMD and they are saying AMD driver is not supported in my PC. Then how they were working earlier!And even after downloading Realtek drivers the sound does cone back but for some 24 or more hours only, after that same issue is happening again and again, so evertime I have to download the drivers when it happens and it's just 10 days since I bought this laptop, how can I keep doing it for the next few years!!Plus I also found wifi issue in this laptop, it sometimes suddenly stop showing me all the wifi networks in range even when wifi is on, and then there is no internet. So I have to go everytime to wifi settings and do troubleshooting and then the issue gets resolved. This has happened 4 to 5 times now just aftter 10 days of using, can't imagine how much more it will happen in next few years!!!Even if hpsupport was good, this should not happen with a brand new laptop and Amazon return window is closed within 7 days only but I thought it's a small issue and won't happen again so didn't apply for return but can't even replace it now.Really a dissapointment from HP!!But other things are really good about this laptop- the screen, keyboard, touchpad, looks and many other things but this driver issue just brings it all down.So better dont consider buying it."
4,"The screen is 15.6‚Äô‚Äô FHD but without any anti-glare coating.Keyboard is backlit with 2 levels of brightness. However, the alphabets on the keys could have beenbetter marked in black to make it look more prominent. The keypad is huge with a numpad. Typing feelsgreat.Apps open quickly. Booting time is hardly 8s.The fingerprint sensor is quite fast and accurate.Speakers are back firing but are loud enough.The build is premium with minimal flex on the lid and keyboards. The lid wobble is absent.Track pad is ideal sized and supports multiple gestures.Office home and student with lifetime validity is pre-installed.Battery is great. I received it with nearly 50% charge and it lasted me almost half a day with typingarticles, 30 min of watching videos. It charged from 15% to 60% in 35 min.The power button is placed within the keypad.I haven‚Äôt gamed in this one but will update once I do."
5,"This is a clean and elegant device. The keyboard strokes are so smooth and makes you to type more. Weighing at 1.75KG it handles with ease. The FHD display with thin bezels gives you an immersive viewing experience. 16GB of RAM, SSD and Ryzen 5 gives you instant responses. It also upgraded itself to Windows 11. One issue was with '@' and '#' as they couldn't be typed. HP Support asked to uninstall and reinstall keyboard driver to solve the issue. However the laptop seems to work fine now even without doing it. Fingerprint reader is fast. The aesthetics is great minus the stickers. Overall a worthy purchase. If you are eligible for exchange please use that option and use credit card for getting a better deal."
4,"Hello Guys,This is the best laptop in normal usage and i am writing this review after using it for two weeks now.It is giving 6 hrs of battery back up in normal usage like watching videos, normal coding and browsing.The Brightness is nice and Performance is super fast.I am very much satisfied with this AMD Ryzen 5 processor.The SSD slot is expandable upto 1 tb. RAM is 16gb65 watt fast charging which charge the laptop within an hour.Overall its a very good laptop i bought it around 56k in the sale with exchange."
5,Hello guyzzIf you are also confuse for which laptop you should buy i was same confusedBut after getting the hp pavilion 15 ryzen laptop i m very much satisfiedIt's been a great laptop around 60k budgetEverything is just fab16 gb ram 512 ssd is bestScreen far betterSound classWindow 11FingerprintEverything is best
4,"I have given the comments after using 1 month.1. The product looks awesome.2. Fingerprint works so fast.3. Performance so far is good with lightweight gaming.4. Getting too much heat while playing the game.5. The major disadvantage is engineers have fitted the laptop fan near the display. Whenever the multi-task is running in this system like the software upgrade, playing any games at that time system will get heat so the display also will get heat.I guess the display will go off another few years because of too much heat."
5,"Liked the construction, finish quality of the laptop. Excellent performance, boot time is good. Upgrade to windows 11 easy. Good battery backup. Go for it..just note though, laptop purchased for normal use including coding, didnot try gaming performance."
5,"Been using this for more than a month now. There are some pros and cons, but for me personally this laptop is great amongst the options currently available. Realme and Redmi laptops provide better value overall, but I don't trust the chinese brands much in terms of security.Word of Caution - Don't buy pavilion 14 ec0000AX or any model with nvidia mx450 graphics. Before purchasing this laptop I bought that one and suffered in agony. The bios update on that laptop will bring your battery down to 2.5-3.5 hours. Out of the box that laptop was working well but as soon as u update to Bios F.07 version, the battery is getting drained without any load. I ordered two of those before buying this one. Hp needs to fix their bios for that model. This laptops' bios is fine.Pros -1. Good Battery Life (around 6-8 hours)2. Stays cool to touch (yet to test it around summers).3. Can be power throttled by Ryzen Controller to use just 3 Watts of power.4. Keyboard is fantastic for typing.5. Screen is bright enough for indoors and good enough for general media consumption and coding (Only 67% srgb, but screen still looks beautiful). You might need to color calibrate it in the windows.6. Aluminium build on lid and keyboard deck.7. USB C charging support.8. Looks premium and modern.Cons1. Wifi is horrible. Out of the box wifi wasn't working. After updating to the latest bios and windows version wifi is running okayish. It still disconnects abrupty sometimes.2. Battery is small, only 43WHr. If it was 56WHr it could easily stay on for 10 hours.3. Trackpad is okayish.4. Screen is not color accurate. Out of the box screen has warm colors overall ( I prefer slightly colder colors on screen, fixable in windows color calibration tool )."
3,"This is the one of the beat configurations I have come across. Of course it is on the expenaive side but it has a strong built. The design is spartan except with one major flaw, the power button is placed besides delete button.looks like HP tried to save some money on designers."
5,Good Performance. Good battery backup. I basically use this for coding. For my purpose this is really a good Laptop at this price. Previous laptop was Intel i5 and I was little confused whether to go with AMD processor. But my decision was right. Packing and delivery was also good.
4,"It's a good system, we bought it for our daughter but there are some audio issues. The audio does not work when it initially boots."
5,Best laptop under 70K
5,"Overall fine product, good battery life. Lightweight. But when i run VMs then it get heavy fan sound. Rest is alright. Processing is fast. Good picture quality."
4,"Everything is good except my unit had noticeable IPS glow so replaced with another one, but that too had the same issue...Modern display IPS panels have this common issue...My 4year old acer gaming laptop did not have this problem...But apart from that I am good with this laptop..Premium look and feel...Built quality is good too...Only the bottom cover and keys are plastic...Rest are aluminium..."
1,I ordered 2 laptops back to back with AMD processor . having wifi signal strength issue.Please dont buy this model with AMD.
4,"Great Performance with multitasking, stunning picture quality , paid services for free with limited time period. amazing sound quality with B&O speakers. you will fall in love with the sound. Overall great purchase. Go for it with no doubt"
4,"Overall Worth for the money, product looks good. When i was buying the product it was mentioned fingerprint scanner present in laptop. After getting the product only i came to know that finger print is available for the 16 GB varrirent not with the 8 GB one."
4,Sound quality is very poor and even screen display not worthy
5,Usually very fast for Normal usage compare to Intel IT .No lag
5,This product met my expectations. Thank you Amazon
5,Really Good laptop for everyday official work (not gaming though)!!- Good Display- Fine Fingerprint reader- Fast SSDOverall Really good experience
5,Worth the price you are paying for it
5,Superb product in this price band.Performance- GreatBattery backup- So soScreen- Great
4,4.5/5
3,Not able connect with AirPod pro
5,Hp coming out with ryzen models is a welcome sight. This model has everything with 16gb ram and a 15.6inch display that makes up a great screen real estate. Laptop boots up in less than 10 seconds and battery life is decent as well.If you're looking for a ryzen model then you won't be disappointed with this one
5,"Have been using this for last 5 months. Elegant design, works flawless, smooth as butter even with multiple worksheets, mail and VCs running simultaneously. Decent battery life, soft touch keypad, anti-glare screen. Perfect work companion!!Check prices and deals across before purchasing. I got it for 48K elsewhere with deals and card offer."
4,"Performance wise it is good. Quick start and shutdown as I did not load any other software‚Äôs so for now it seems good. Low weight easy to carry, just need to cautious not to bump it to wall or objects. Very lean. Display is too good. Sound quality is hmm a bit ok  but with drivers (That you need install with update- though not requried) you are getting equalizer thats good similar to realtek. Upgraded to windows 11 that changes everything. If you are a gamer and heavy user I recommend to go with gaming laptops where you get more features and high specs with just 8-9K more. If it is only for office work with multiple applications being opened at same then its ok. U can opt for this."
2,You tube 4k video is keep loading in this laptop with 300mbps broadband connection. My 4 years old Intel i3 laptop with 4gb ram is running 4k videos like butter (without loading). But this 16gb ram model keep loading. Think twice whether you will need this model laptop.
5,Excellent Laptop. Performance is amazing. Must go for it . Laptop justifies it's price. Great deal . . . .
5,It is fast for non gamimimg uses.battery life is 5to 6hours only for normal use.i use it for study working fine for me.
5,"First Impression: It looks beautiful and is very sleek.Internal Hardware: Seems normal and good enough for daily use purpose. A second slot for ssd would have been nice which is missing and halts us from upgrading storage. I know we can replace ssd but what will happend to the one present?Keyboard: Its kind of sluggish but will get used to it. Backlit is a plus.Screen: Its not anti-glare otherwise its good.Performance: Mine was AMD, and its a beast in performance.Build Quality: Dont try to pick it up with single hand. The buld quality is plastic and feels kind of weak. It tries to bend when picked up single handedly.Ports: Enough Ports. Does not have ethernet port. Also the type-C port has thunderbolt sign."
4,"Product design looks good, good display, decent b audio, tacky keyboard and good battery. Boots up fast (SSD!)The price could have been better.And missing on finger scanner!! This was missing information from the Q&AAlso office 2019 is just installed, but not activated. Microsoft account is required to activate. And If you are using a license elsewhere against the Microsoft account, then you will have trouble activating.. Factor this please"
5,"First I thought that i5 non pavilion laptop will be good but I was wrong It is superfast and super slim and nothing can compare with its look I said nothing. Very fast processing speed. Fully personalised for professional use, if your work related to office and you want to imprssüòç your colleagues then go with it. Sound quality is ‡§ú‡§¨‡§∞‡§¶‡§∏‡•ç‡§§. I bought it in 46k by exchanging my 10year old dell laptop, but for yours in the price range 56k go for it."
5,Look of this laptop is unbeatable... üëåüèªüíØ Dusre Laptop me specifications aur aachi bhi thi lekin looks me iski takkar ka koi nai üëåüèªüî•
5,"Battery is 5-8hrs (No gaming). My Basic Usage is YT + Vscode, GMeet, Other streaming platforms.  Build Quality is Awesome.  Hinge looks a bit of a problem though.  Ryzen 5 5500U is the best for students who dont want to do gaming.  2 level Backlit is good.  4x2 ram is a Con.  Webcam and sound quality is okayish.  Keyboard keys are awesome love them."
1,"The Laptop would not even turn on it had a black screen could not even configure it, Has it unpacked for all of 15 mins repackaged and returned to Amazon who till now have not initiated my refund despite an unusable product"
3,"Decent for office work, its just you can get many service benefits if you buy it from store. Amazon isn‚Äôt providing any support/service! Also as its 11th generation, it should be having windows 11 and not windows 10.Other than that its a good product."
5,"Screen quality is good, product is slim & light weight & all metal body is very aesthetic with the silver colorIt is too early to talk about performance but it is quite fast & great to work with - thank you hp"
1,What the hell is this new laptop having some lines on the screen
5,Brand . Best  Battery With Windows 11 update...
4,This is nice product in this rangePavilion series metal body but not entireOnly suspicious thing is processor is amd ryzen
4,Good but price could be 50k approx
5,Value for money
5,"Good looking, good performance, good battery life, Nice screen go for it."
5,Worth money product won't regret buying it
1,It is a trap. They don't provide any cashback. I lost nearly 2700 because of this false promise by amazon
5,Awesome
5,Ok
4,Lite weight laptop
5,"The product was properly packed. And about the product, if you want a compact laptop with considerable performance, this is the one. The 8GB RAM and the SSD is really making wonders, helping the system load faster irrespective of the application or task. I'm using them for music production which doesn't need much graphics, so in case you're a graphics guy, go for other ones with additional graphic card."
4,"Good laptop for personal use. R5 makes it a good deal at this price range, go for it if your usage is limited to browsing, ms office, light games, OTT.Comes with 1 yr + 90 days McAfee antivirus.No finger print unlock and no backlit keyboard.Overall satisfied with this Dell Vostro 3405Installation can be done by ourselves, don't go for additional paid service. Warranty, Windows and MS Office can be activated by ourselves, watch youtube videos of this laptop for instructions if you need help otherwise its self explanatory."
2,Pros: Great Display FHD AntiglareGood experience with built-in speakersAverage CPU ExperienceMemory can be expanded to 32gbPre-installed Windows & Office which comes handyCons: Bad battery management ~ 3hOnly 8gb memory shippedCamera not as expected with this priceLinux Drivers missing/not installableNo backlit keyboardHeating issueABS Plastic body instead of metal which has poor heat resistanceNo Windows 10 Pro version. You have to purchase separately.Overall not recommended for the price of 48k.
4,"Dell Vostro 3405 , amd ryzen 5 , 8 gb ram upgradable , 512 ssd.First impression is really good ,looks and feel- light and shiny ,-Quality of plastic used could be improved , doubt if it can last for years- touch pad is quite responsive, keyboard is excellentboot time is under 10 secs , amazing combination of processor +ssd + windows 10 os+ mcafe av I got 2000k cash back for effective prize came down by 3-4 k including discounts from credit card etc.overall product is amazing at this price point .with upgradable ram upto 16 gb in future , 512 ssd is reasonable bargain at this price .I would recommend this product for general use , with low or little  gaming ,or less  graphic intensive  use .specs are certainly good , but the body is plastic which casts doubts on longevity of device over time and general wear and tear.Above all the support from Dell and Amazon support is great.Thanks"
1,Product is Well packed. Look wise also product is good..But performance wise very poor from the 1st day ownwards.
4,"I have searched more than a month for buying a laptop, and i choose to buy this laptop due to this laptop configuration. It has AMD rysen 5 which is equivalent to the Inter core i5 processor. core i5 processor laptops are more than 50k, but i wanted to purchase the laptop below 50k, so selected this one.for Processing and configuration wise this laptop is fine, but the material seems like a plastic, lightweight and keyboard also hard to press not smoothly, and appearance is not okay with budget"
4,"I am happy with the system , but battery what dell write in product  6 hrs  its not that its only 2.5 hrs. Otherwise everything ok."
5,I like Dell laptop and its usage.
1,"Right after the return window got over, laptop was not booting. Battery light  flashes with 2 times amber light and 7 times white light. It was a LCD issue. Gave for service. This issue after purchasing the product after one week of time. Really bad experience."
4,"Writing review after 2 weeks of usage, nice product, no issues till now but battery life could have been more. Need to upgrade the system regularly, camera quality is not really good"
1,Worst sound effect.we can‚Äôt hear anything
2,"1.System getting overheated,2.Speaker disconnecting issue,3.Screen lagging"
2,Heating issue from the very forat day.Charger and laptop get heavily heated in minuted after use.
1,I suggest no one buy please dell it's very poor quality and the keyword is not working and also heat problem it's like it will be blust
5,Superb...
2,Guys don't buy this laptop because it's getting heated up fast in 1 minPls don't buy
5,Superb performance
5,"Better than expected, powerful machine"
3,Everything is nice except the over heating issue.
5,"Overall performance is good but, it's get very heat up very quickly.."
5,Nice product
4,Two issues it heats a lot and sound is very low.

5,Value for money
1,Heavy hitting.
5,Awesome üëç
1,I want to give zero star...Dell vostro..is Dell's worst product..I am suffering since bying...Never Dell ....go to hell
5,"Good laptop, working fine battery time also good, good graphics.. Overally best laptop under 50000. Best use for college students and tech people."
5,"I had exchanged my old Dell laptop for this Acer laptop, its pretty good i don't use it for gaming, just office work and internet use.I have not experienced any issues till date. Its thin, lightweight and the screen size is quite good 15.6 inches and awesome battery backup. Overall i would give it a 5 Star."
3,Build quality of this laptop is good. But the processor is very slow. It gives response after like 10 seconds of command which is quite irritating. Just 2 days of using this laptop and I want to return this but no option available.
5,"This is an perfect Laptop for mild office work, binge watching.. bought it just for 15k with exchange offer..."
1,Home laptop. Processor is extremely slow. HDD crashed within 8 months of purchase.HDD crashed within 1 year. Extremely bad and slow processor. No post sales service. PatheticNot at all recommended.

1,"Hello pplI am writing in distress. I bought this thing with 16gb ram 1 tb ssd from acer store and it was delivered less than a week back. Today, after I had hibernated it, it has refused to start. I am getting  blue screen with mouse pointer responsive. But since it's a public holiday and weekend, the company is dead. No support, take ur risks. Even went up to the escalation matrix and they were rude to say the least, unhelpful being part of the job. My job is at stake but the gentlemen tell me it's late and not done at this time of the night. A fair appreciation when ur job is not at stake coz I cant recover data I produced in last three days by monday morning when their support opens up. Well I guess u pay for ur mistakes. First time I trusted acer instead of hp/ asus/ dell and the lesson is hard. Take ur risks guys and buy it.Update after  a yr. the laptop has its own mind wrt the shift key. u cant work on it. acer says we dOnt have record of having SolD it to u> they are asking for an invoice which they NeVer sent. when I had asked for an invoIce, they had told ME WE KEEP DIGITAL copies FOR EnvironmentaL stuff> now they seem to have changed their mind> go figure !!"
5,I received damaged product
5,Very fast booting process good quality but keyboard quality is not very good.
4,"The laptop has good specs. Booting time is very less. I basically use it for office work and general surfing. Overall happy with its performance in one month. Only point of concern is the 512 GB space, which might be less for many."
1,Mcaffe trial license usage had already expired. N it shows warranty period remaining as 11 months and it was already activated almost a month before I purchased laptop. Be careful.
1,Camera quality is soo much poor and built quality is very weak.
1,I would suggest never purchase anything form amazon i have bought this laptop from amazon and it is having 1 year default warranty but when I received the product it is showing only 10 months warranty. I am continually chasing amazon but they are not able to resolve the issue each time i have to explain the issue from start
2,"I was surprised when I got the product, the laptop is sleek however the build quality is very substandard. The keyboard keys and the plastic used is of very low quality. Not happy after paying 55k for this."
3,"My opinion is Better to buy electronics in stores rather than online.... Iam very dissapointed i bought washing machine, tv and laptop and even mobiles none of them working well....i think some scam is going between amazon and constumer... Easily heated..charging capacity is very less.... Some one is replacing the parts of electronics b/w amazon store to constumer"
4,"The laptop is very good but not the best. Just as the rating says, it has four good things and one bad thing out of five features.Pros:1) Outer design is good2) Fast processing. The combination of i5 11th gen, 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM and 32 GB Octane memory is so good that all of the software applications together are working really great without any lag.3) The boot time and shutdown time is so quick. It hardly takes 7 seconds when starting up and similar time for shut down as well.4) The weight of the laptop is too less.5) Awesome Sound Quality. I keep the sound level at 30-40, which is good enough for watching a movie. Just imagine what 100 level volume gives you.6) The features that are already provided like MS Office lifetime and the price that I obtained for are cool.Cons:The battery is not that good. The specifications in the amazon product detail page says 8 hours, but it gives only 4 hours of good working time. And if you are working on multiple applications, it is further less. Also, the keyboard quality is too bad. The letters and numbers are like painted kind just as the marking paint on the roads."
4,The laptop works fast and downloading speed is superb......The problem is just this that the build quality of it is not good......I mean it can be pressed easily.......I recommend you all to buy this product
1,heating problem üòëüòë
1,"The laptop screen is defective. It does not have proper brightness. Also the screen is yellowish. I tried returning the item but Amazon suggested a visit from the technician. The technician was supposed to visit today but at the time of appointment he updated the system as problem resolved without even contacting me. Now I am stuck with this laptop. This is very poor from Amazon and really disappointed with the whole process. Being a such a big MNC , expected better response from Amazon for such a big ticket purchase of a defective product."
4,Value for money laptop1. Better Speed2. Great Display3. Medium Weight4. Strong BuiltCons:1. Keyboard keys can be better.2. No backlight keys.
5,"It's nice for daily day to day use for light work (as that's what I am using it for). So not faced any problem untill now, I like it's black colour & nice screen."
4,I bought this laptop on 1/12/2021This is best for studentsAnd best display qualityAverage battery backup maximum upto 4 hoursAverage build qualityPerformance is more then enoughOver all best laptopIn this laptop there is no backlight keyboardA keyboard with numeric keysHp 15 (2021) model has a backlight keyboardSoI'm satisfied with this productAnd amazing delevery by AmazonI ordered this laptop 30/11/2021 time 1PMAnd I received this laptop 1/12/2021 time 9:30 AM
4,It's good and fast work ing for me. It mention Microsoft Office Home & Student 2019 free software given. Instead 2016 version provided. Do not give false information.
3,"Everything is good in this laptop, except for one issue.On trackpad, when you place your cursor somewhere, it just moves up and down continuously and sometimes even just jumps to some other place on the screen.Noticed this issue on Chrome & Windows11.Not sure if this is due to Win11 or not, but I have been using it only on Win11 as laptop came with Win11 only.So, am planning to return it."
1,Good performance but batteries performance is very low while using any photo shop and other applications battery will empty very fast not it will not comes a hour and camera quality is also very low worst camera very disappointed warranty is already started before I buy the laptop
2,"Laptop is configuration wise and buildwise gud.Battery backup, Display, Process speed all are good.But in amazon selling the used product i think so. I registered for warranty that time it shows already 2 months gone."
4,This is a value for money laptop. I got this 51000/-. But company should provide WIN 10 PRO version.Except this laptop working very fast. Boot/shutdown time 3-4 sec. Battery back up is 4-5 hrs.
4,"First of all the box was broken at one side, I thought it might damage laptop but not. The laptop is very light weight but getting heatup very early and it has noisy fan. The exhaust fan facing towards screen looks very bad design it heated screen.Overall ok product and delivery."
5,"I bought it for 50k during offer,everything is awesome about lappy,value for moneyBattery 5/5Booting 5/5Build quality 4/5"
4,"Product is light weighted. Big screen, big size keyboard. Keys could have been better."
5,"Fast booting, loud speakers"
1,If you are compromising the warranty or if you are okay with already opened and activated product then it is perfect.  Quality wise it is good but two times i got product but both are activated 2 months before i got the product where warranty got over by 2 months before receiving the product
5,"Very good laptop battery going 5 hours and charger also only 41 watt so I can charge whole laptop on UPS with 90 mins 0 to 100 charging , c port is availbale, 8gb ram with 2 slots means u can add 8 gb more ram value for money in this range 512 SSD"
5,"Very nice looking, rough surface to handle easy, very fast login and shutdown. Fast and smooth performance üëå"
2,"I put this laptop into sleep mode and when i reopened it it showed BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH(bsod)... This was on my first day. I hav never put this in sleep mode since then... Heats up pretty fast and battery drains even though no apps running in background... Literally just has 4 apps. Came pre-installed with shitty win11... I guess thats what is causing so many problems. Also, came in a flimsy cardboard box instead of a secure box."
4,I liked this laptop. Only issue I found was hp warranty started two months before my purchaseSo I got less than 10 months warranty on product against ‚Äúits being started from date of purchase.‚Äù
3,Are you sure this is a new laptop? the McAfee is already expired.. and HP Laptop OEM warranty expires on 17-10-2022.. means this is already activated by someone? looks like this is refurbished.. Thinking of returning the product.. send a feedback to seller and waiting for answer..
2,It said MS Office bluntly on the title and barely offered a trial version which stopped working in 28 days. It wasn't mentioned that it's a trial version. We were scammed. This is extremely unacceptable.
4,The performance & all other things are good but only the keyboard quality is not at all good. If the keyboard is good then the Product would have been very good.
1,This is one of the most wast product from HP. pls dont buy this Product it my experience off this product....
5,"Cons: The ON indicator placed at the right side corner and charging indicator placed at left side corner which are not easy to notify.All other things are nice including fast booting, fast retrieval of files etc."
1,The hinge of the laptop gave up within 15 days of use . The return period also has expired . I don't expect such a poor product from Dell or does Amazon stock sub standard product and sell it at discount as a new product. Now I have to take it to the dell after sales service .
1,"It has been just 25 days since I purchased this product. The seller listed for this product is Appario Retail Private LtdWithin the first couple of days I faced the Blue screen of death errors on this laptop. I ignored those issues as I felt that it might be due to apps i was using.Today when I opened my laptop , the side covering for the screen just tore off like a cardboard paper. I have a feeling that this laptop was a refurbished piece which was put together and just put up for sale on Amazon.I have posted pictures of the current state of this laptop so that others can be saved from such an horrid experience."
1,I thought it has backlit keyboard by seeing reviews and answers but i have received the laptop without backlit keyboard
5,"This review is for the Inspiron 3511, D560581WIN9BE model:- Comes with Office 2019 lifetime- No backlit keyboard- Performance is good, been using it for school work without any hassle- Upgrade to Windows 11 was smooth- Battery lasts well, 4-5 hours when on zoom calls- Screen is quite ok, the brightness is good for daylight workUpdate: November 12The screen hinge is super weak. I started hearing a noise when opening/closing the lid. At one instance, when opening the laptop, the hinge was completely dismantled from the screen and the lid could no more be opened. I've send the laptop to the authorized dell center and awaiting their response."
1,"Within 15 days use, while opening the screen frame came out. The plastic quality and body frame is pathetic and third grade. Didn't expect this from Dell as I have used Dell laptops and even using another one at present."
5,"Laptop quality, design, screen quality is too good. Battery backup is also good.Backlit keyboard is attractive and the touchpad is just outstanding.Touchpad works so smoothly.I am very happy for this.Also Amazon fast delivery within 3 days.I got this 37k in Great Indian sale.I recommend for this really nice laptop.Also built quality good."
5,I wanted 15.6 inch screen with antiglare 256 gb ssd i3 11th gen best build quality with dell branding. ...dell service is also best ......battery backup is not too good ....it  is about 4.5 to 5hr .....it may be because of 15.6 inch display.....overall i am fully satisfied with this product
2,"the keyboard quality is very poor and i am hocked to feel that this is a brand new laptop received an hour ago and even with just 10-15 mins of work, it is heated. what will happen after an year? don't recommend:-("
1,Serious Design Flaw hinges broken with in one month. I am traped in newly launched model of dell inspiron 3511. Dell is number 1 laptop and is known for his durability but this model is realy very pathetic. I purchased this laptop only considering the hinges design which lift the laftop when laptop lid is open. That time I was not aware that this is the biggest problem of this model. Don't buy this laptop if you are going to spent your hard earned money. Please see other brands and models. Don't have less than 1 star otherwise I would have given zero.
1,"This is very unlike Dell , this model has serious design issue , left screen is locked and can't open the screen .Quedtion mark on Dell service,Complaint  reported on 26th Oct till date not resolved as the part is not available?Don't choose blindly Dell"
1,"Its a very delicate product, cheap plastic body and keypad are worst. The hinges are on the rising side so any or little pressure and they broke within 2 weeks from purchase and cost of replacement is 7k. so not worth it."
1,Within 15 day Hinge problem. Poor quality plastic and build quality of very cheap plastic there used . don't buy it  ..  waste money.... Seller should refund amount to the product immediately soon.and the Amazon n seller had worst response about our problem .best to go for flipkart. I think seller played trick on people for money and looted us..
1,"It is a terrible product for the price you pay. The LCD hinge is odd and different from usual laptops as the screen cover curves below the laptop base.One of the LCD hinges just broken within 2-3 uses of the brand new laptop !! That too without any rough usage or falls. And once the LCD hinge breaks, the screen cover just comes off.Feels like a really terrible and risky design flaw. Please AVOID THIS LAPTOP to save your money."
1,The hinge broke within a month and the LCD got separated. Dell customer care unable to resolve the issue. I will go to the Consumer Court.
1,I used this product for around 10 days when the hinges broke. I called the dell support team that day only. They confirmed for replacement around 20 days later. It's been more than a month now and it is still under process. Everyday they come up with a new excuse to get out of replacement. Today they said the invoice isn't valid because it doesn't have the service tag. How is that something I can control? They sell on Amazon. If they want the service tag of the laptop on the invoice they should have put it there. SLOWEST CUSTOMER SERVOCE EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN. During Covid times when a person needs their laptop for their literal earning I have none because on this.
1,"Once you purchased a any product from online you will never be changed the product in very simple way (apko 50 bar mail or phone karha padega). I have investe more money which I have in capacity, thereafter my problem not resolved by anyone. Please help me"
1,Within 30 days of getting this product. The hinges came off while using the laptop.On contacting the service center this seems to be a common reported issue with this model.The service center experience is also pretty bad with dell these days I have been waiting for a fix for almost a month with no response.
1,"The screen got damaged within a month of normal usage and tried to contact Dell with no help.A big scam running over hear, the laptop is refurbished in the name of new laptop. The seller & amazon is fooling out the public. The new laptop is registered in the name of somebody else.Tried to reach out amazon but these guys won't entertain as the return period is already over.To repair, Dell is asking for atleast 45 days of time. Who would wait for such a long time ?"
5,Overall very good purchase üëç
5,Best laptop in This price..Many people says it is not a good laptop ...But trust me It is amazing Laptop.For Day to Day Use.Cons:-1)No backlight keyboard (but it's not a big issue)............................Seriously it has no more cons .......Laptop is light weight..Build quality is awesome.Keyboard quality awesome.I use this laptop for programming and online classes ....Very smooth performance.
4,"if you are looking for a laptop which can be used by school going kids...this is a good one to consider...it can do most of the things, online studies requires..also can be used to stream videos etc...played asphalt and it looks good on it...audio quality is good...camera is also OK...you also get Windows11 upgrade...which was also seemless to upgrade...overall a good purchase..."
4,"I'm using this for past 1 week without any issues. Overall product is good with smooth performance, good resolution, pre-installed MS products etc. Could have been better with backlit keyboard, finger sensor & camera cover option which is available in 15"" inch variant."
5,Super awesome laptop....runs smoothly ...valorant runs on it like fluid...just amazing
5,"Light weight,smooth to work , processing is better"
1,Worst ever product i got it... They mentioned processer is 4.2GHz in specification and when it came it was 2.42GHz ....and when replaced that same product came with 4.2GHz.And now when i am calling to return it no one is receiving call..... Even with app also i am not able to place return order it says to contact us and which again does not get connected... Really frustrated with such service
1,Pls don't buy Laptop or costly things from Amazon. They give used products and then don't replace itI recd approx Rs 59000 laptop which was used since April 21 as per HP site. I purcahded it is July 21It is sluggish and slow and like old i3 laptop. Their reolacememg inspection agency did not visit my house and replace request was denied. I learned a lesson by spending approx Rs59000. Pls don't buyNow tjey
1,It says Full HD screen and they delivered with a HD Ready screen.My mistake is that I didn't search for the model no and check on hp website.
1,"Truly disappointed with HP . Its a corei5 11th gen laptop, which heats up like old amd laptops. I urge everyone not to go for this one. HP need to think and change this model. Thanks to Amazon for accepting the return"
1,"Do not buy, received laptop today afternoon and stopped working in the evening. Not getting any help from Amazon.Update: got a replacement laptop on 11 of august which is even worse. Warranty is showing less than year. Warranty start month is April? How is it possible? Definitely a used/refurbished which Amazon is selling at a price of new product.As usual Amazon customer service is of no help even after providing pictures not listening anything. Product description says it has 1 8gb ram and one empty slot is there for expansion but actually it has 2 4 gb rams. If i want to upgrade the ram to 16 gb i have buy 2 8 gb rams instead of one. Keys are already loose and seems like keyboard is used for sometime. Doesn‚Äôt appears to be new product.Don‚Äôt buy this item from here, you will regret."
1,Worst product...may be a repaired..keyboard not working properly and Amazon took 1 month for refund after several stress making followups...from my experienceIf you are going to buy a costly product don't go for online stores..your money will be locked and you will be in struggle .
3,"There has been an incorrect description of this product.  The display quality of the is really bad and strain to eyes, one can not use for a longer time.  Please be watchful before buying it.  We did not have the IPS version and opted for the Full HD version but it is nowhere near that.  If you are going to use a Laptop screen for primary display purposes, this laptop is not ideal.  The description should be fixed ASAP."
1,Battery life extremely poor. Keys are depressed at left and right side. Heats up quickky. Have bought laptops from amazon before but this has been a bad experience.
2,"Got this laptop delivered fast and was quite excited about the it but, unfortunately it started showing error from day 2. When I submitted for a replacement sellers wanted me to wait for inspection. Now just holding the unused box with me. They have not done the basic quality check before dispatch. Also the laptop was configured months ago even before purchase so I am losing warranty period. Quite disappointed with this purchase"
5,Reviewing after 2 days of usage.Pros:Great weight reduction. Feels like a toy in hand.Smooth operationGreat speakers and good sound reception by mic.Superb battery backup as thin & light laptop class.Comes bundled with lifetime support of MS Office Student 2019. Just you need to sign up and activate. No need to look out for 'managed' crack versions of office.Cons:Not FHD display.No backlit keyboard. Have to pay another 7000 INR for these two features.No ethernet port.No DVD writer (not proper to write because it is not available in any thin and light series).Only 02 USB ports. Could have given another USB port on left.Batteries can't be removed by user of his/her own.Verdict: A superb purchase under hp brand within 55k INR budget.
4,"Whats to like about the laptop:1. Performance: If the laptop is primarily being used for school work - Zoom, MS Office, Web games etc you'll have no regrets. Apps launch quickly, run smooth and you can easily switch between multiple apps2. Aesthetics: The laptop has a very clean look once you remove the HP, Intel, Microsoft stickers.  Being very light (<1.5kgs), it feels more like a 13"" laptop when carrying aroundWhats not to like:1 Keyboard. The thin grey lettering on the silver keyboard is hard to read depending on the angle of the light - which is often enough.  This model does not have a keyboard backlight either. In the same laptop series I have a another laptop (10th gen) which has a backlight but the situation is hardly better. If however you touch-type, it shouldn't matter too much.2. Durability: The Keyboard / trackpad quality feels quite flimsy - being the light plastic that it is to reduce overall weight. After 5 months of use the rubber legs have pealed off.OtherScreen: The laptop only has an HD resolution screen and not a FHD. This translates too having lesser real estate in comparison."
5,"First of all this is a very very good looking laptop. The size is absolutely perfect and the screen is amazing, not anti glare though. The processor does its job without any hiccups and battery gives back-up for 5-5.30 hours. SSD with NVMe interface is very fast and I did not experience any heating issue as such. It comes with MS Windows 10 Home and MS Office with lifetime validity. Overall this will be a good choice for anyone who is looking for a lightweight and compact laptop with amazing performance for work or study purpose."
1,"Amazon cheats with its customers ,by not allowing the return of the product. In the Amazon website battery life mentioned is 9.5 hours but it's giving just 1.5 hours, video & sound gets distorted in video meetings.Also keyboard is not working properly.On top of that, Amazon executive says , ""don't teach me ,my job"", like this ,these guys treat their customers"
3,"21oct 2021 I purchased this laptop. All the features are same as present in the description. Only processor issue which I received 2.4 Ghz only.Many users are complaining the same but they are still not changing the product description in the bottom.Replacing the laptop just to verify and wanted to get high speed processor as mentioned into below description. It should be upto 4.2 not accurate 4.2 in the product description,which is very confusing."
1,"Within 20 days of usage, the laptop started having problems with the battery, taking 8 to 10 hours for charging and the machine getting overheated. Calls and complaints to Customer Care yielding no response. Disgusting.üëé"
2,"The laptop specs and performance as such is good, but I received a defective piece. I don‚Äôt know if it was a quality check issue or something went wrong during packaging and transit. It seems like the keyboard backlit was left on for a long time with the lid closed. The complete keyboard layout got permanently etched on the screen. Amazon‚Äôs return policy for laptops is not straight forward. You‚Äôll have to go thru a technician who‚Äôll visit and determine if it can be fixed or returned. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt face much of a hassle to initiate the return. My overall star rating is for the quality of the product being shipped."
4,I liked the laptop. Very light weight and convenient to use. Can go for it if you are looking for an everyday use laptop. Battery performance could be a bit better but in all I like it.
2,"I bought this on 4th of july, installed android studio and started running the program through emulator, laptop started stuck. It has 8gm ram i did not expect this behaviour.I have observed, it is providing more heat.And more over the sound is coming, when u started the emulator.And return policy is Worst. It has only 7 days of time. If it exceed, then they will never take return.I have compared hp with lenovo as suggested my cousins and colleagues. Finally i went with hp. Now i am regretting to buy hp."
3,The battery backup  will remain 4 to 5 hrs and some heating issue there. I bought for 59k and if it may contain fingerprint sensor and anti glare screen would be the best. Performance is good and very light to carry. This lap is best for programmers and students.
5,The product is truly awesome. One cons that i observed is during the video calls the laptop heats up higher than usual.
5,It boots up really fast. 7 seconds to be exact!And it runs all softwares with so much ease. And so fast. bindblowing!!!It's really worth for the money
4,"Bought this laptop for my kids to attend online classes. Fast booting in 10 secs and smooth operation. Compared other brand models in the same range, less features.  No fingerprint reader ord keyboard back-light. Sturdy look, Good display."
5,"Other than the heating issue, which is also not that great a problem, I do not see any problem with this laptop. It gets all the work done and quickly, has free Microsoft office Home and Student, FHD screen, and it's super light and handy."
1,"Dont buy this touchpad is very noise, looks cheap plastic . You cant see the letters of key board from all side you hv to adject every time to see letters. not value for money."
4,"1 Laptop work smooth2 Even video editing3 Light weight also4 Some problame  only two  uab type a port in single side5 display quility is very despointing in this price range.. not an ips display . If you are a creater this display didnot meet your requirements  so choose a ips display laptop6  key boards had not backlight  you can't use in low light7  photoshop cs3  and some softwere didnot run in this laptop, but cs6 run8  cyber link 17 dont runs in this pc  but  cyberlink 20 runs in this laptop"
1,I got this laptop just today and the processor speed in the laptop mentions as 2.4Ghz and in the product description as 4.3GHz. Mc-caffe antivirus had also expired as soon as the laptop got booted. Looks like a renewed one. Dont go for it.
1,"F11 key popes out the first time I used it. HP service asking 7k to replcae the entire top panel plus keyboard as they claim this isn't covered in warranty. Really disappointed, go for a apple instead at least the quality is top notch"
1,"Don't buy HP laptops online if you stay in Odisha. HP service centers will not help you they will simply ask you to visit sales counter for your problem. Don't upgrade to windows 11, it has lot if issues. Unfortunately I don't have an image to post. I am regretting now buying HP laptop online."
1,When it's delivered it was already logged by some other user and I called HP helpline they confirmed that it is registered with that other user name. I couldn't be able to login in this laptop.
3,I use this for my personal use.
5,I'm happy and satisfied with this laptop as it suffice my purpose of use as both in office and personal....very light weight and easily portable....loved it

3,"Specifications are good at this price.And boot time is 5 sec.Performance is extremely good.All software are run fastly.But built quality poor, laptop hole made of plastic.To reduce cost, they compromise with quality, :--1) plastic built2) camera is only 0.3 MP so it was very very bad.3) no backlit keyboard4) no type-c port5) no face unlock6) low battery backup 3 hr7) blurry screenOut of 8 GB ram 2 GB occupied by its integrated graphics, so only 6 is usable."
1,This looks very cheap quality laptop and don't take risk to buy this it is totally weste of money. Thanks you
5,"I have both Dell Vostro 3490 & Lenovo IdeaPad S145. AMD Ryzen performance, 8GB & SSD Harddisk gives a better response & performance. I would say value for money. Go for it. Both come with similar price tags but Dell got 4GB, SATA HDD which impacts the performance in a big way."
4,"When i bought this it was having a 1 star rating and that too by 1 rater. Not convincing right? But then i found the same laptop listed on flipkart at a higher price and much higher rating. Though the configuration always attracted me but it was lack of interest on amazon which was keeping me at a distance. Seeing the flipkart, i quickly grabed it and found the laptop as expected. I am not an expert but it is an overall nice deal. Got it exchaged for my 11 year old pentium and final price around 23.5k. issues like weight a bit higher despite no cd drive, keys positioning, user memory available showing around 3gb, low audio and mcafee trial ver."
4,"Machine is little flimsy. Performance is good as it is loaded with ryzen 3200u, 8gb, NVMe.SSD. It took me by surprise on my first boot the key strokes didn't work. Audio is merely audible. Overall OK for simple everyday use."
5,I am doing research from one month for buying a laptop and after all the hustle my luck bring me to this laptop. My genuine suggestion to all who want to buy anything just wait for right time and keep patience you will definitely get a good deal . By keeping patience and waiting for right time I got this laptop for the least possible price .And I don't think I have to tell you about the specs of this product you already know it.So coming to the main point!! it's BATTERY BACKUP== From 100 to 0 it gives me 5 hours while watching Mirzapur through WiFi .That's all.Try to buy anything during sales whether buying it in normal daysBelieve me you will save Thousands ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ.
4,"Pros:High Performance, definitely better than Intel I3Integrated Graphics, one can easily play games at medium settingsBuild Quality is greatKeyboard layout that too a full length keyboardScreen size and quality at this price pointSSD at the priceCons:Camera! 0.3 MP VGA, that's itNo backlit keyboardBattery could have been improvedOverall, go for this laptop. Great Deal"
1,Some of the keys of the keyboard are not working. And amazon arranges technical support after a weeks time. Decision will be taken after that. Sorry for inconvenience is what they say.I approached a Dell authorised service centre and rectified it. Its better to p purchase laptops from authorised store's than Amazon.  The price is hardly different.
5,Performance is mediocre. Boot times are blazing fast. Install linux and enjoy it's full potential. I personally tried Pop_OS and it runs like a charm. You can play old titles and some light weight games. Don't expect high framerates in AAA titles. But old games like GTA 5 are playable with around 40 fps in low 720p. All in all a good buy and Lenovo's thermal management with AMD chips is very nice. I could hardly hear the fan ever get loud enough to be audible even under heavy workloads like gaming.
5,i bought this laptop when there was no review . i am the first person who purchased this laptop from amazon . i was very scared about this laptop but this is the best best laptop . and it's best for gaming also it has 2 gb video ram . i am using form 2 weeks and it's very fast and very very awsome laptop . battery is also awsome . it's gives 5 hour back in normal use and while gaming i gives 3 hour back. it's come with mcafee antivirus i month free trial and i purchase 1 year mcafee subscription in just 269 rupee and it's best antivirus.
5,"Its One of the Best Budget Laptop you could get it, I got it at 28.7k during Happiness Upgrade Days,Pros:-*8 GB Ram and SSD OF 256 GB (U will get around 197 GB to use)*MS Office can be activated for lifetime by registering Microsoft Account*Battery is Pretty Good, it Depends on usage ,For normal usages u get around 4.5 hours on various Usages (thats enough for all the students and Professional  works)*display and Sound looks Ok üòä*Outer Body is made of plastic, should be handled carefully*Camera not so good : if good lighting condition are there u could get good clarity, in dim light u expect a  good one* Keyboard  and Track pad is awesome to typeCons :-*Camera should be improved in Lenevo laptops, is not upto the mark (for the price ok.)*should have provided additional slot for HDD expansionIt's based on first impression, will update after few weeksGo for it Better than dell and  Hp with respect to Price and specs*Ryzen 3 better than what i expected."
3,"It worked fine/well for almost 11 & half months (though the battery never delivered what was promised).Now, it starts, power LED blinks for 3 times almost, and then suddenly shut down.Nearby exclusive store diagnosed a motherboard issue and asked to visit New Tirupati Cellular in Pimpri, says he is an authorised dealer.I hope they repair it at earliest.I will further add about LENOVO SERVICE EXPERIENCE once I go thru it. Thanks"
3,"Don't buy ,it's my sincere request to all not to buy laptop online ,spend little extra cash and buy from the store , just 3 days after buying the laptop my laptop has hanged . MS office is on trial basis for a month after that I will have to buy the software and same thing is with the antivirus . This was my first time buying a laptop online and this would be my last , if a thing that cost 35-40k and it's hanging just 3 days after purchasing , Amazon is making a Fool out of us ."
5,"Really a value for money Laptop, Very slim and light weight. If you plan to buy a laptop go for any laptop but with below specification1. AMD processor ( Ryzen 3 or higher)2. You must have SSD storage (enjoy super speed)3. 8 GB RAM minimumPls note all the above should come for 30k (+/- 2k) then you are going on a right choice.Also look at the battery power (good one should have 6 Hours backup)"
4,"Best laptop in this price range, good and premium look, enough RAMof 8GB. Little short with storage. Battery backup is average.1. Premium look2. 8GB ram3. 256 SSD4. MS officeCons1. Average battery backup- 4 hours2. No USB 3.03. No ethernet port4. Camera quality - not that good.5. Display view angle is less."
5,"Bought it during Great Indian sale in October 2020. Among all the laptops within 30k price range this is undoubtedly the best one. Don't go for 1TB HDD version instead choose 256GB SSD even if the storage is low. You will thank me in the long run. You can upgrade your storage later if you want.Pros:15.6-inch full hd screenfull-length keyboarddecent battery life256GB SSD comes on m.2 slot which is great if you want to upgrade your storage as the 2.5inch slot is emptyCons:the camera is 0.3mp, poor qualityno backlit keyboard"
4,"Brought at 30k, worth buying at this price.Reviewing after 1 year of usageüòÇ.Working fine and maintained it's fastness.laptop boots in 6 to 10 seconds.Batery backup is around 4 hours now.Had issues with keys, after 9 month of purchase.Contacted lenovo service and had hassle free service from Lenovo.Keyboard replaced under warranty onsite that to in  tier 3 city.It is eligible for free windows 10 upgrade."

5,*Best Laptop under this Budget .*It is for  daily use laptops  .*But fast accessing*Battery level only three to four hours*But if u want to buy laptop under 30000Choose this laptop
3,"Reviewing after a month of useValue for money, good performance as expected from ryzen 3 , boots up in 15 sec ,Gaming - GTA V 30fps @ 720p enjoyable , 20fps @ 1080p beautiful but not playable.Valorant - 55-65 fps (max 76fps)Photoshop working good , blender lags & isn't good for extended work session , android studio running good , build quality is not good , camera is bad"
4,"Got the laptop yesterday for around 31k, Overall good laptop look wise good it boots really fast for me it take 5-6 seconds .But the camera and sound quality is not as good so these two are the cons which can be improved in the actual price of 42k ."
5,This is an awesome product and well packaged.The laptop is working well. There is no sound produced by the fan. The booting speed is quite well. The performance of the laptop is awesome.The quality of the product is good. The battery life is very good and it stands up to four to five hours. The screen is not bad but that doesn't matter. This laptop is good at this price. 30k.
4,"After doing research on internet, I selected this product and it is amazing with high speed of processing and response. Under budget, it is best laptop with 8gb ram and ssd making it a lot fast speed machine. If you are thinking for i3 then you can also consider ryzen 3. I got this laptop at price of 31k."
5,"I have been using this for 3 weeks now for official purpose. And my experience is excellent compared to price of the laptop, it is fast and light weight.If you use web cam a lot then it dosent have a good camera..other things are totally fine."
5,First of All A Good Product From Lenovo with such Amazing Specs !Pros :Performance : 4.5/5Battery :4/5 (4.5 - 5 hours Normal Usage)Display 4.5/5Build Quality : 4/5 ( Plastic Build )Speakers : 4.5/5Keyboard : 4/5*Cons*Trackpad : 3.5/5Camera : No RatingsNo Type C port and RJ45 Port !
5,"Good packing & i got genuine product, Thanks Amazon..."
4,Slightly on the bulky side for those who prefer lightweight laptops. But good value for money as combination of Ryzen processer and SSD disc is value for money for everyday task and normal office work. We use it for mostly editing in Word and it performs effortlessly on that front.
4,"The product is good, light weight having around 4 hrs battery life.speed is also fine but this product has very less sound.The only negative point is its sound.you can not enjoy any moview without head phone or a sound bar."
1,Never buy lenovo laptop. Only in 11 months without much usage laptop not working properly. And lenovo customer service for repair is pathetic. 14 days have been gone since i have made a service request on lenovo customer support website but till date no solution at all. They don't care what you have gone through. Don't buy lenovo laptop otherwise you will surely regret on your decision.
1,"This is Lenovo's worst laptop to buy.First of all build quality of laptop is so cheap, keyboard buttons are made of poor plastic, body is also made up of plastic with cheap aluminum make up.out of 8 GB RAM 5.88 is usable only. Sound quality is terrible( fake Dolby speaker ). Display quality is so poor. I don't know how long it will last. AMAZON is best KABADIWALA!"
5,"Really amazing product at this price range, I loved the design and it's battery life.its good light multitasking as well! I have been using from 5 days, and I didn't found a single problem with respect to performance!"
3,only 190 GB Usable from 256gb SSDonly 6 GB RAM Usable from 8GB RAMwebcam totally scrapAverage battery.
2,Ms Office was not pre-installed. Although while purchasing the product it was clearly mentioned it would be pre-installed. It was confirmed by Lenovo technical support.
4,The product is very good. I have give 4 stars because the camera quality is not good. If this can be fixed I'll be happy as my job requires a better cam.My organisation's tech personnel had advised me to buy this. It's working well!
5,Best laptop under this budget performance of the laptop is very good suitable for daily usages but  not for heavy gaming  over all it is a good laptop
4,Better speed but less storage. The choice is urs u might be comfortable with less speed and more storage.  The best deal in this price range although to reduce the cost they made the product fully non metallic. So it should be handled with care
5,Very slim/light and gives the feeling of a premium laptop..running blazing fast as of now..I trusted without any prior reviewes available and it did not disappoint!
1,Laptop stopped working in about 2 weeks of use. Power is off and does not turn on.

Everything about this laptop is just phenomenal except that there is no backlit keyboard and antiglare display which is a bit disappointing. Now this laptop can be easily used for coding, video editing, gaming but not extreme, surfing internet and everything else which remains üòÇ. And remember never believe on any youtubers reviews cause they are all paid actors. PEACE OUT ü§û"
5,"Awesome piece from hp. Processor and performance is excellent, battery backup is excellent up to 7-8 hour. Premium look at this range. Best and affordable for college's students and also for working on it.Just go for it , best laptop under 50k"
4,My previous AMD processor used to get hot very soon but someone told me to buy this new version and it doesn't heats up but it does gets hot though intensity is lesser this time. May be coz of metallic body
4,"Was worried abt performance due to AMD processor. But I must say performance is on par with intel i5. Screen quality and anti glare is working smoothly. Build quality of laptop can be improved little. Build quality is good but can be better. Very thin light weight ( can hold with one hand). Charger is 65W fast charging.Battery backup is for 5-6 hours for normal use. Didn't play games, so can't comments abt gaming performance. Got McAfee antivirus 1 year subscription for 299 rs. Win 11 upgrade available for Laptop. MS office is licensed and already configured.Got 7000 rs as exchange for old laptop. On top of that, 2000 rs on Amazon icici card. 47k laptop cost me 38k.  Amazon rocks.Just go for it. Good for business purposes where multitasking is there. For students you can purchase Ryzen 3 series which will save you few bucks."
5,"It is a great buy and more so for the price. Super fast, great battery life, intuitive OS. All around great laptop.My only problem is that soon after getting this I bought a HP ink tank 319 printer (Rs 14000ish) only to find that not all printers are compatible with cromebooks. Imagine that... HP crombook not compatible with HP Inktank!!!"
1,"Recently I noticed that the battery keeps showing 99% when not plugged in and no matter how long i keep using my laptop still stay stuck at 99 and shows 100% as i plug in charger and gets back to 99 as i plug charger out.Sometimes my laptop switched off all of sudden due to zero battery whereas it still showed 99.My battery life is still good I'm able to run laptop on normal usage from about 4 to 5 hours(tested after like 4 hours of charge), I've replaced it once but the issue is same."
1,"Issues with battery percentage it always remains constant neither increases or decreases and when it gone to total drain state suddely it will power of and with this we loose unsaved work in laptop , i faced this issue in replacement product too so please check after purchase about this issue"

1,"Keyboard is not working for a new laptop, then see how the Acer Laptop products are. Suggesting plz do not buy any ACER PRODUCT LAPTOPS.  I also called Acer Service station and they are creating service tickets and assigning the work to a third  party service stations in Hyd. So we don't know what parts they will change from this new LAPTOP. Currently I have given my new LAPTOP to a service station in HYD and still the keyboard issue is not resolved.Friends, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT GO FOR ACER LAPTOPS and do not waste your valuable money."
3,"It's been hardly two months I purchased this system. Transferred all data from my current laptop to this one. It was working just fine so far. Today suddenly it became overheated. It's been more than 2 hours and its neither cooling down nor switching on. I was only using basic apps like word, mails, etc. I don't play any games on the laptop so I am not sure why this issue cropped up."
5,Good value for money.
1,The display cracked inside after 2 months and Dell service centre says it‚Äôs accidental damage and that it cannot be replaced through warranty. Disgusting
1,MS office 2019 life time free not installed. Microsoft login but payment option open. Laptop not working. Bad item send seller. Replace/Return process not started by seller.
5,Excellent laptop at this price. I don't want to write a detailed review because every thing is good about this laptop..just go for it.
1,Screen blinked and laptop stopped working on first day. Amazon has scheduled experrt visit. Not satisfied with resolution. Want total refund. Duplicate product.
1,"Bought 2 Laptops. One is crashing constantly. Other the Touchpad does not work. Amazon is now selling junk. They have changed replacement policy also, so they will sell Junk to you and then make sure you cannot return it.!!..Now they are corporate thieves"
1,While typing cursor behave absurd . It keeps shifting the places and we are not able to type properly
1,Under 1 month battery problem and keypad button problems doesn't work properly  so don't buy
5,screen quality is too goodbattery life  is normalif you are buying ssd version than its booting speed is too good boots in 7-8 secondsprocessing is fastcamera quality is averagealthough it is a better product and worth the moneybuid quality is good - plastic not metallic
5,"Instead of spending more money for i3 11th generation , This laptop is far better, because it comes with SSD and HDD. OS runs like rocket in SSD.Even i3 5th generation can work faster when you upgrade SSD to OS. Buying the latest generation is myth.Always last 3 generations will work as same, its just combination of specs like SSD, RAM, HDD.To Conclude , this laptop is best in segment.Amazon delivered as promised with 100% quality."
3,"Writing this review after using it for 11 months now. I use it for programming. I can say it not good for heavy work like coding, designing, gaming, video editing etc. It is getting hang now and then since couple of months. Please buy only if you need for browsing and working on creating documents like word, excel, powerpoint."
5,"Pros -4GB RAM is enough to complement the 256 SSD and 1TB HDDLaptop is light on weight, compact, slim, sleek with lesser screen size, which makes it perfectly portable for travelBattery backup around 3 hourComes with an impressive miniature charger from DellCons -No backlit keyboardNo charging or power lightsBody colour is not elegantMicrosoft Office tools not pre-installed"
5,Good quality
3,"Loose keyboard, touchpad.. Heating issue"
4,"Overall is best product if i want to highlight SSD feature is very good which make use of laptop so fast and responsive,Drawback : I found like charging takes a lot time more that usual normally i tought it will take 1hrs but this product takes 2 hrs for full charge laptop . which is not good they provided 45w charger, it should be 65w .Dell should look into it rest all good.Thank you Amazon for such a great product!! Happy to work on this :)"
5,"Excellent buy, Good Deal by Amazon."
4,"After going through all reviews, I was lil bit confused but now I am much satisfied with my purchase decision, better than going to a showroom and become prey to them"
3,"Dell product, I don't have words.All rounder laptop, just not for gammers,I loved boot time it's around 14sec whole day around 5-6 times i am using switch on and off button :)Just buy this product if you're Dell lover.Happy new year guys üòÄüéä..."
5,Very light weight product. Must handle it with parents supervision of its brought for kids below 8 yrs. Handle with extra care product
1,I am afraid how I should use this product. It can crash anytime. I can't keep my data in it. If again any other part will go than. Very bad experience.  Company should improve quality of parts.
5,Really value for money very good speed no leggings.
3,slow speed
5,Good Purchase. Very sleek and light weighted.
4,"I received unit with a faluty screen, there is a gap between scrren and body at right hand bottom corner. I realised it 2 days after installing my data hence had to use it."
5,"A very good purchase. Good product, very smooth easy to work on. Light weight and very easy to handle."
5,RAM is not upgradable. Better for business purpose. Light weight and handy one.
4,Great configuration. I checked the specs using device manager. Matches the product spec in the description. Acer has included important software of it's own. Nitrosense has good ui but could have provided some tweaks for setting custom cpu frequency along with presets. I can do this in power manager but still one place to do so would be good.Pc health check shows that the system is ready for windows 11.Build quality is not up to the mark. Could be the only minus and one less star.A word about packaging. Thank heavens acer packaged the laptop really well and provided good protection with tear detection stickers. Amazon apprario retail put that in a  bigger box but forgot to tape one end. So the acer box could have come out of the box any time and I would have received an empty big box. I sometimes wonder why amazon bothers to put things in disproportionately sized boxes and forgets to seal it properly. Do the people who handle the packages just tear things apart to see what's inside or is it just the time pressure that they don't care to seal it properly at the beginning?
5,Very good product for anyone purchasing laptop in under budget of Rs 1 Lkh.
5,Good gaming laptop
4,"Overall satisfied with the product. There are some heating issues which is expected in a gaming laptop. Good cooling system with orange backlit. Smooth touch pad. You will get McAfee Antivirus for 15 months, windows updates, etc."
5,"Overall good. It has 4gb graphics which is enough to run any softwares like AutoCad, cataia, creo, solid work etc..... Its a gaming laptop too,. Sound quality is goood. It comes with web cam n i must say camera quality is good here.. I personally found it goood experience.Just worth it.You won't regret after buying this laptop..."

I wanted to buy SSD version for office and this worked perfectly. I bought 5 qty for office.1. 15"" screen2. 4GB RAM3. 256GB SSD4. Good battery backup upto 5 hrsI have added 8GB extra RAM so total with 12GB RAM, the laptop works at lightspeed."
5,Amazing product with an excellent configuration. I am in between an intermediate and a heavy tech savvy computer user and have been using various computers over 20 years now.I was quite cryptic before buying this one with only 2 reviews (at the time I purchased).But this is a good laptop at great price.People need to understand that SSD should be a primary choice of storage now when you buy an i3 laptop and expect it to be fast.Do not buy this if you play games or plan to run some heavy apps on it.It is a decent product for everyday use such as browsing and office apps.
5,"Very good Laptop. Compact, Fast, Ultra Slim, Hinge moves 180 degrees. Startup is just 10 seconds. Microsoft office and mcafee free for 30 days. Only camera should have been better. The rest is absolutely fine."
4,Battery:The battery is built in to the laptop & hence not external. The battery readings (time left) appear to be erratic.Response: Response time is very short because it has an SSD instead of HDD.
5,Authorised and genuine seller
5,Good product... it's truly an value for money... battery life is amazing..but the camera quality is very bad.. over all this is a good laptop in a good price.
3,Pros:Sleek and slim.Nice speed.Cons:Display quality is poor.It does not have MS Office.

4,"At this price as per my perspective, the configuration and performance is good. This color is something look like old one after seeing on second day itself, there were hand prints on the front side after touching it :)."
4,"Good design, anti-glare, keystrokes feel good. Just that dual boot gave too many issues. Couldn't do it till the end"
4,I did some research and finally got it.A good laptop with light weight but slight weak battery.Overall performance is good laptop is fast.I will update further after using it six months.
3,I have bought dis lappy once a week ago in 32000 online . Web cam is not good quality. Battery will not last more than 2 hours. I am not satisfied wid battery but it's good.1 more thing is that amazon is taking 2000 extra money for this.it will nt be more than 30 thousand.

4,"This is one of the better value for money laptop you could find online. Its got latest i3, SSD ,a decent HD display. I only gave it 4 star because of its RAM which is only 4Gb, atleast ,8GB would have be great. Anyway you can upgrade it if you feel that your laptop is slowing down after sometime. It would cost around 3-4k INR.Some compromises where indeed made, but its not right to pin point everything which would otherwise don't matter to most users.Pros:-----------1- i3 10th gen ifor this price2- SSD storage is an added advantage for faster app opening and boot speed3- Windows 10 runs really smooth4- Display is antiglare5- Battery life is decent at 4-5hours6- Build is all plastic but its surprisingly good. It can take a beating.7- Speaker quality is good but not loud, so consider buying a Bluetooth speaker for better audio experience.CONS:----------1- Display quality is bad when compared to laptops with IPS display2- For some reason I am facing issues with premier pro. It just hangs after sometime. Probably seems like a bug.3- KB is not backlit. :(."
1,Please don't purchase this laptop. Due to poor battery and screen resolution. U should go with dell and hp only.
4,"I brought the laptop in Great Indian Sale for ‚Çπ50,000. Its been working fine since then. Battery life is good about 7 to 9 hours. Features are Windows 10 OS upgradable to 11, i5 11th Gen, 178 GB usable SSD, MS Office 19. Very sleek and works smooth. The only disadvantage in this laptop is that it doesn't have backlit keyboard so it is difficult to work in low light or in dark. If backlit keyboard is not a requirement then go for it as its a great laptop at reasonable price! Hope the review helps."
4,"**Initial View**In the current market scenario i find this laptop well featured with a good price tag. Build wise good plastic quality. Screen is good with good color accuracy. 11th gen i5 8Gb ram sufficient to handle day to day work. Exchanged my 7 year old HP  i5 4th gen for 13k and got this for around 40k. I am happy with the purchase. I feel its way better than Lenovo Slim series in every respect. I was confused whether to buy this or any 10th gen i5 gaming laptop coming at similar price point(though i don't play any game :-p ) but decided to go with the former for newer gen processor.One thing that was a disappointed me was the lack of backlit keyboard, i specifically asked in Q&A section of product page. The person from manufacturer answered and confirmed of having it. But to my surprise it doesn't have one. This is the one let down of the product to be honest.Overall its a good product. This is my initial view, will post final view after some days of usage.**Final View**Upgraded ram to 16GB (Adata 2666Mhz ddr4 8GB) and working properly in dual channel mode with the supplied samsung ram module. Buy any ddr4 ram 2666mhz and CL19 and it will work in dual channel mode for slight better efficiently. Added a 240gb ssd in the vacant 2.5"" HDD slot. Upgraded to windows 11. Every things is working fine, i am satisfied with the purchase."
5,Thanks Appario received as brand new with nice packaging and this dell product is simply best at this price as per my observation..configurations may vary little with other chinese products but DELL is DELL..
1,I just brought this new laptop by 20th oct for personal use. In 5 days only top layer screen has broken. You can see in images. It seems it is not tested property with new design. Now situation is I can't close the screen as it is keep on breaking. I am not able to understand how to use warrenty.
1,"Built of the machine is very poor. Hinges are poorly designed .I do not recommend this productOther issuesWhole laptop vibrates to sound while playing music or video. we cannot lay hands on the laptop.Material used for the laptop is not upto the mark.After using 1 month, one of the hinges failed and unable to close and open the laptop.as display beed is getting ripped off.When I have contacted DELL support for service, after placing parts request, i came to know that parts will arrive by Jan 2022 .such a horrible service for new laptopsSometime touch pad wont work.I request amazon to offer me a different product with in the same price."
5,"This Laptop is good for Daily use, its very quick as it has SSD and i5 11th gen. i7 are more expensive and I do not think its necessary to go into i7 or i9. Although the SSD is having only 256 GB, it can be upgraded if you want or you can always use online cloud storage to store data.The screen quality is very good! It takes only about 15 seconds to start and the battery lasts quite long and charges fast.  The ram can be upgraded from 8 gb to 16 if needed but its still good at 8gb. The screen size is 15.6 which is going to a plus again.  You will not even hear the fan running unless you do some heavy task such as copying data and it remains cool most of the timeIn my opinion, Dell is way better than other brands,  even if you might not get the backlit keyboard or fingerprint sensor, are these really needed? Considering utility, durability, this laptop is very nice and a must buy for someone who has regular use.There is also an antivirus subscription for 15months included, amazon audible included etc.If you want something sleek and simple, this is a good option! Go for it!For Gamers: I am sorry I can not give you any advise :D there are exclusive laptops meant for you which may be more powerful, so,  maybe you can find more about those before thinking of this one for gaming.I did not initially see the reviews for this laptop on Amazon, but I think that a review can help someone to make the right choice, so I just wanted to share my opinion :)There are some other variants in this model such as 1TB hard drive + SSD . If you need more storage, you can go for that variant."
1,"Faulty product, not support from dell care and amazon. Service is booked but marked as service completed without visit. I exchange my old laptop , now I don't have my own, which I have is not working. They sent OLD REFURBISHED MACHINE and cheated my money. Be aware of this kind of Amazon Fraud. Machine is not working"
1,I am fedup seriously booking electronic items through Amazon online. They are just delivering low quality cheap products. on 10th Oct'21 Amazon has delivered me Dell Inspirion 15 3000 laptop :. This is the condition of laptop now as shown in snaps. In a month time the strap around the screen is getting dislodged and I am clueless Amazon delivered me this less quality product. Please dont opt to buy this product even if the offer is 90%. There is no proper customer support as well.
4,This laptop is good for its price and specs. Super fast and no fan noise. Little heating issue on the top side. Overall perfect for business and coding as good ram and processor.  Buy it blindly‚Ä¶ good keypad and display.

3,Battery life is good. Works for 6+ hours once fully charged. Display is nice with update to Windows 11. Facing heating issues since day one- upper strip on keyboard between keyboard and Display gets quite hot. Would love to keep it if not for the heating issue.
3,I bought this laptop its showing 256gb  ssd in Amazon but in real  tey procide only 220 gb ssd.. i don't know what it is.This laptop looks very cheaper than its competer in market. In 51k is feel 30k laptop. Performance is good but in this price tey don't even  provide backlit keyboard...  I personally suggest you don't go for black color.. silver one is much better ..

5,"I bought this laptop especially for the Ryzen 4700 processor which is really hard to get at this price point.

Camera is the weakest thing in this laptop. The battery life is also not that great. I was getting about 5-6 hours of uptime without charge. But the charger is fast charger. Also i wish it had USB C type charger instead of the normal one. The speakers are fairly decent.

4,"1. DesignI consider Lenovo‚Äôs ThinkPad series to be the absolute benchmark when it comes to productivity-oriented laptops. For the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, Lenovo has tried to bring some of that robust and practical design to this meant-for-the-masses laptop. And safe to say, Lenovo makes this rather uninspiring laptop appeal in flesh. This has got a full metal body but with a luxurious ‚ÄúThinkPad-esque‚Äù matte coat of paint for the deck.2.DisplayThe IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, as the name suggests, comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. There‚Äôs support for a 45 percent NTSC color gamut and it can go up to peak brightness levels of 300 nits. The refresh rate stays standard at 60Hz, which seems alright given that this isn‚Äôt a gaming PC.3.BatteryWith its 3-cell 57Wh battery, the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 is rated to last up to 11 hours at a stretch. In the real world though, I found the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 lasting on an average of 7-8 hours on a regular working day with my kinds of abovementioned workloads, i.e. 9-10 tabs on Chrome with a constant connection to Wi-Fi networks. The 65W adapter tops up the battery from 30 percent in under an hour. Additionally, I was also able to charge the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 using a 65W OnePlus USB-C power adapter.4. PerformanceHappy to report that the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14-inch feels snappy and handles multitasking very well. Working with 10-15 tabs open in Chrome at the same times proves to be no issue, even when editing spreadsheets at the same time.The Ryzen 4000-series chip is behind this impressive performance, and in Cinebench the 4700U competes with the Intel Core i7-7700K. Even more impressive, GeekBench 5 gives us a single-core score of 1,092 which is on par with the Intel Core i5-9400F, and the multi-core score of 4,800 even beats the same chip with a noticeable margin."

1,Warranty was only for  9 month instead of 12 month as claimed. Very poor support from Amazon even after raising complaint against seller.
5,Brightness is good enough matt finish works great.Camera is ok but it can be better.Processor is great.GPU is great but u may consider its really less storage if u go for high-end gaming or video editing.Battery life is good enough.NOTE:- Ram isn't upgradable.
5,Very lightweight. Monster battery back up. Faster response for multitasking. Pls read product specs for more details abt component or reach out to me for usage related queries
5,The battery life is too good approx 6-7 hrs .on full charge.Camera is Ok for your regular vedio calls.Brightness is good.Over all a good laptop for business and daily use.A higher end laptop at cheap price.
4,"This is got to be best ultrabook which is priced less than 60K, I bought this at Rs.58990/-  from Appario Retail Private Ltd. SellerIts model name as per lenovo website is ideapad 5 14ARE05Various features are not mentioned in product description page and I was doubtful when I ordered whether it will have certain features like fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, etc.Turns out it does have fingerprint reader, backlit keyboard, MS OFFICE(home and student) lifetime validity.Comes with a feature where laptop automatically boots up when the lid is openedBoot up time is less than 13 secondsKeyboard panel area( palm rest area) of laptop has got a matte finish, does not feel slippery, feels good to hold.Getting Battery Backup of more than 6 hours, just doing regular tasks, no gaming. ( it has different modes such as Intelligent cooling, extreme performance, battery saving mode, I have kept it on intelligent cooling mode, you might get more backup if you are using battery saving mode)My device came with Premium Care Warranty Pack (i.e. It has a base warranty as well as accidental damage protection for 1 year)Now there are  some negatives:You cannot completely bend the display to 180 degrees ( like few others Lenovo laptops)Audio Quality is Average(no bass)Camera is below average(its actually worse than you expect it to be)You may feel the base of the laptop warm although CPU temperature didn't cross 50 degrees Celsius mark. But still there is a bit of warmth at the base when you are using on your lap.Overall a very good purchase, you can go for it if you are looking for a 14-inch laptop in the 60000 price bracket.(excuse me for any typos)EDIT : RAM is NOT upgradable (Laptop was listed recently on lenovo india website and RAM is onboard, contacted the support number to confirm and the representative has confirmed that there is NO second slot for RAM)"
1,I don't know...wtts the issue...is...bt within 10 dayz...it's heating like hell...In just 10 dayz...it's Boot time increased...it became slow....it ssd...read spreed...feel likes it's been forever......worst part is...now I cannot even replace it.....I'm stuck with it....
4,"I'm satisfied with the product ,Lenovo has done great job ,the build quality is good ,I have been using it since a month now ,it gives 7-8 hrs of battery life including my online classes and some research and just some YouTube.the speed is good and thats expected with the processor in it ,overall a good buy I would say."
5,"I bought this laptop especially for the Ryzen 4700 processor which is really hard to get at this price point. This is my honest review after using this for about 4 months:Build: Super build quality. Very compact and light in weight. No creaking or bending happens even when you push it. Only one small thing, the laptop lid opening could have been smoother for one handed operationPerformance: This is the USP for this laptop. Ryzen 4700 is superfast and handles almost anything you throw at it with ease. The SSD helps with the speed tremendously. It takes 5 seconds to boot up which is amazing. I didnt game on this but i am guessing the processor can take that up as well. All applications run smoothly and there is no lag even when multiple applications are open simultaneously.Other pluses: lifetime free office 2019 which is a great addition and free upgrade to window 11 will also be available. Stereo speakers with clear distinction and front firing speakers to avoid any muffling.Cons: The camera is simply horrible. it gives grainy images even in best lit conditions. low light performance of the camera is abysmal. Camera is the weakest thing in this laptop. The battery life is also not that great. I was getting about 5-6 hours of uptime without charge. But the charger is fast charger. Also i wish it had USB C type charger instead of the normal one. The speakers are fairly decent. Not very loud and punchy.Overall, for office work (apart from video calls) and normal day to day useage, this is a great buy."
5,"Its a complete package for professionals as its sleek, portable and powerful. It does all your important office work and even lets you enjoy basic gaming on the other hand.Great matt finish on the top with the metallic upper body.Awesome keyboard with suitable backlight.The battery performance is decent!The speakers are on the weaker side, but does the job at times depending on the media.Connectivity options are great! Fingerprint reader is amazingly fast and the touchpad is also smooth.For the people who love good screens, this one delivers the HD content really beautifully and yeah, it has great viewing angles. Go ahead and watch your favourite shows and movies on it. Its not very bright for outdoors, but won't even disappoint you completely.I am a professional technical writer and have to run multiple tools and do a bit of coding as well. It has proven to be a perfect fit for me.You can go for it blindly if you are looking for a portable, sleek and handy laptop."
1,"Misleading images...no usb c charger in the box , barrel pin charger given in the box. No barrel pin dc in port in the images but there's clearly one on the laptop...extremely annoying,  now I have to spend another 3.5k to get a 20v 3.25amp USB c charger."
5,"Except for the fact that 16GB variant was not released in India at the time of purchase, it the greatest in this price range without a doubt.The only cons that come to my mind:1. It's srgb rating is around 54% or something so basically not for you if you are a content creator with a need for colour accuracy.2. 16 GB RAM is not available and 8GB RAM is soldered so, RAM not upgradable.So if you don't fall into the category that has a extreme need for them, then just go for it.Now then lets answer some obvious concerns regarding a laptop:It has a metal outerbody so doesn't flex.It has a empty m.2 NVME SSD slot.Battery is long enough.Keyboard is great and so is the track pad.It is upgradable to Windows 11(for free of course. Just keep the windows updated and it will eventually show the upgrade when released.)It is not noisy.The speaker are good, as for loudness, windows laptops never specialized in this area did they? Lol. But it is loud enough.Webcam...don't expect something magical, its just enough for video call purposes and such things. Because laptops don't specialise in this area due to demand for thinner bezels.Mic is clear.Well, these are the concerns that I remembered on the spot and answered, I will try to update it if I remember something else.And for the ones new to this AMD Ryzen 7 is a processor that is supposed to rival Intel core i7 but ryzen 7 generally is a better choice as it performs better for better price and lesser power consumption. This is because they use 7nm chips while intel still uses older ones, and SSD is always better than HDD. You can always confirm this on internet."
5,"Excellent product, light weight, very fast, doesn't heat up, and long lasting battery. No problem is using it continuously for 6-7 hours to attend online classes."
1,Guys please do a full testing on the new laptop for defects and issues pls dont blindly trust these people as I had worst experience with 2 laptops buying from Amazon.Pls pls dont assume things and keep the laptop do a test and then come to conclusion.
5,"Lenovo has some of the best cooling fans so forget heating issues , Boot time is  less than 10 seconds due to SSD availability, best of Daily office work , decent battery life , Charges with type C port as well , fingerprint scanner is quick , Anti glare display with Backlit keyboard , been using it since over 4 months now , This laptop with such configuration is a complete packageBonus Tip : Opt forAMD CPU compared to Intel ONES ,AMD Ryzen is miles ahead in terms of performance"
4,"1. DesignI consider Lenovo‚Äôs ThinkPad series to be the absolute benchmark when it comes to productivity-oriented laptops. For the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, Lenovo has tried to bring some of that robust and practical design to this meant-for-the-masses laptop. And safe to say, Lenovo makes this rather uninspiring laptop appeal in flesh. This has got a full metal body but with a luxurious ‚ÄúThinkPad-esque‚Äù matte coat of paint for the deck.2.DisplayThe IdeaPad Slim 5i 15, as the name suggests, comes with a 15.6-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. There‚Äôs support for a 45 percent NTSC color gamut and it can go up to peak brightness levels of 300 nits. The refresh rate stays standard at 60Hz, which seems alright given that this isn‚Äôt a gaming PC.3.BatteryWith its 3-cell 57Wh battery, the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 is rated to last up to 11 hours at a stretch. In the real world though, I found the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 lasting on an average of 7-8 hours on a regular working day with my kinds of abovementioned workloads, i.e. 9-10 tabs on Chrome with a constant connection to Wi-Fi networks. The 65W adapter tops up the battery from 30 percent in under an hour. Additionally, I was also able to charge the IdeaPad Slim 5i 15 using a 65W OnePlus USB-C power adapter.4. PerformanceHappy to report that the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14-inch feels snappy and handles multitasking very well. Working with 10-15 tabs open in Chrome at the same times proves to be no issue, even when editing spreadsheets at the same time.The Ryzen 4000-series chip is behind this impressive performance, and in Cinebench the 4700U competes with the Intel Core i7-7700K. Even more impressive, GeekBench 5 gives us a single-core score of 1,092 which is on par with the Intel Core i5-9400F, and the multi-core score of 4,800 even beats the same chip with a noticeable margin."
5,The laptop is gives me good experience. nice keypad. track pad gestures are giving fast work experience. IPS Display giving crisp and clear screen. Colors are great. Speakers giving good sound quality.  Wifi 6 connectivity great connectivity. never feels like working in Wifi.Cons.Laptop comes with only two USB ports. that also in right side only.  No USB in left side.  No option to choose OS type while purchase. It comes with Windows 10 Home edition only.
5,"Superior product by Lenovo. excellent build quality considering its price point. NV Me SSD and AMD Ryzen 4700u processor is a deadly combination . Its lightning fast. It powers on so fast that it felt like unlocking a phone. Very lightweight and ultra portable, excellent backlit keyboard also. The key travel and clicking is satisfactory. Color accuracy is not good but you cant expect anything better at this price range . Overall go for it blindly."
4,"overall nice spec in this budget. Thanks amazon for delivering this product in same day that is just in 9 hrs.Prons: 1. Good processor 2. weight is ok in this price range which helps easy handling 3. display quality, keyboard, finger sensor, touchpad , speaker quality is good, all connectivity features/ ports are good.Cons: 1. non upgradable 8 gb ram, camera quality is below than average, UP-DOWN arrow keys are two small for operation"
1,"Nice colour, handy, battery life is good, performance is also goodBut, camera quality is below average, embedded RAM, so u can't extend it in future, after one month of just average use, it starts heating , so cooling system is not good, window hellow for security ( face detection and finger print scanner)  is not supported, even from day 1, me, and Lenovo enginner couldn't fix this problem, and this is not the case of return it back either at Amazon or to Lenovo. So I have to face this problem for life time with brand new laptop worth 61990 .Not recommended for any one."
2,The processor can hardly support games that was launched in 2014 at medium settings. The games start to lag after sometime. HP 5500u  handled the Game much better.
5,The processor is quite powerful since it's an Ryzen 7 but the igpu with 8 GB ram is not ideal I would be better if we had atleast 12 GB and at max 16 GB ram but it's has not updragability option I love the IPS display and lights in the keyboards the only drawback is the ram which affects the igpu's potential

5,Purchased this laptop for my sister and so far found to be good and working fine. Amazon deliver was quick and safely packed.
1,"Overall good, but getting trouble for use Linux operating system"
4,Good to use SSD satisfied
4,Good but the battery is not up to the Mark.  SSD GOOD. RESOLUTION GOOD. SPEED ALSO GOOD. I3 processor with 10 the gen
4,"I'm reviewing the product after using it for 1 week. So no idea about long term usage or customer care service.Pros:Performance: 16GB RAM is more than enough. You can't think more of this. It's damn fast. I tested it by working with 30 apps simultaneously. It worked very smoothly. Also thanks to the latest 11th gen i5 processor. The Boot Speed is also awesome. Thanks to SSD. Overall I'm quite fascinated with the performance of the CPU.Graphics: Decent for your everyday work. It has Intel's Iris Graphics Card. (Not recommended for gamers)Speakers and Microphone: Both are nice. Good bass and quality. But it's not so loud. For proper sound you always need to have max volume. It could have been better and more powerful. Microphone has a decent noise cancellation system.Keyboard: The quality of the keys are very nice.  Contains backlit keyboard. It has separate number pad keys which is very useful. The keyboard arrangement is very good.Battery: On standby it gives 8hrs of battery life. Meanwhile for me, on average online classes it gives at least 3hrs of battery.Fingerprint Reader: Quite decent. No less than a mobile's fingerprint scanner. Opens up instantly.Charging: It supports rapid charging. Takes around 1hr to charge the laptop completely, which is very good.Display: It has a 15.6 inches FHD IPS anti-glare screen, which is decent. The size of the screen is more than enough, it seems bigger than you imagine. It has very narrow sided bezels which increases the screen size ratio. Smoothly runs 8k videos. Average resolution is also good.Lenevo's inbuilt features and tips and tricks are quite good. Has useful shortcut function keys. System customisation features are decent. The thing that I found interesting is that as soon as you open the laptop it switches on automatically. You don't have to press the power button. This feature is known as Flip Switch. You can turn it off in the settings. Doesn't have any bloatware or pre-installed apps. Comes with the Microsoft Office 2019 package.Cons:Camera: Could have been better. It has 0.9mp and the picture resolution is average. Not a good camera. Doesn't look good during online meetings.Doesn't support HDR, 12K resolution, Windows Hello.Battery: When the battery is very low, like 10%, it drains very fast. Battery conservation is average.Touchpad: Average. Sometimes it doesn't recognise your finger gesture. A little high sensitivity.Non Upgradable: You can't add additional RAM sticks or Graphics Card because it's already soldered onto the motherboard."
5,"Omg! What a beast performer and what a beauty. That subtle body is so soothing. That fingerprint reader is so damn fast. Good implementation of soft touch material in the palm resting area near the touchpad. Even extended warranty along with premium care is so cheaper yet better than HP counterpart.Only thing is I wish the machine had auto backlight keyboard timeout i.e. it doesn't automatically turn off the backlit keyboard after some time. If it's on, it will stay on till the laptop goes into sleep. It's okay, it doesn't matter to me.The best thing is that the weight distribution and the vents have been done so well on this device, that it feels lighter than even a 14 inch laptop and doesn't ever gets hot.P.S. beast devices need beast care. Purchase extended warranty along with premium care for this device from Amazon (TPS Technologies) and you can breathe in peace as the extended warranty is directly provided by Lenovo.Overall, it's the best Value for Money device I could have got at this price range. Thank you Lenovo and Amazon ( for delivering within a day and understanding my urgency). Love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,"Likes:Intel 11gen processor - lightning speed.DDR4 16GB RAM at peak speed.Wifi 6.Very fast boot up.Great battery - approx 8 hours.Fingerprint login - fast and secure.Comes with MS-office license.Front facing speakers and hence unhindered good sound.Backlit keyboard with separate numpad (like desktop keyboard)Dislikes:Lenovo apps - would have preferred clean windows. Though no noticeable hindrance from these.Would prefer separate keys for Home, End, Pgup and Pgdn instead of clubbing with Fn+arrow keys for these; though manageable with same keys in numpad."
1,"My first buy of any Lenovo product and probably the last one....!!I'm writing this review after 3 months of use and believe me this doesn't deserve your hard earned money.After just a month's use I stared facing issue with USB ports, system getting crashed while working, keyboard/trackpad/entire device getting hanged all of a sudden and the only way out is to turn it OFF manually. The device also gets restarted automatically without any reason. Even after the device is SHUT DOWN I'm facing the issue of battery getting drained completely automatically.I've tried to receive support from Lenovo Technical Support team but they also failed to address the issues, as the issues keep on recurring even after the fixes every now and then.I also contacted Lenovo Customer Support Team for replacement of my product after like 50 days of usage as the issues were recurring evry now and then and the Technical Support Team wasn't able to resolve it permanently and believe me they have the worst Support Team. They are replying me that since the product is not meeting their DOA guidelines they won't be able to repalce it, and adivised me to contact their Technical Support Team for the issues.So, please guys don't waste your money on this product as Lenovo won't be able to provide you with appropriate support and neither will it address your greviances."
1,"Received damaged product. Selected replacement next day with techni visit schedule, no one came, tagged Amazonian on twitter, a call came, damage photo uploaded on link sent by Amazon, again tech visit scheduled, no one came. Replacement window over"
1,Just unpack and screen is smaller than shown in item description.No numpad.I3 instead of i5No fingerprint scanner.Scratch on outer bodyHave not on the laptop and reviewed the RAM and other details.Very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
5,Super laptop Speed is very fast ‚è©
5,"One of the best laptops  . Love the build quality , fast boot thanks to the SSD.  Finger print sensor works great as well.Battery lasts easily 6-7 hours.Before buying check out the configurations as there are several  available.  Preferably buy one with the max RAM configuration as there is no option to upgrade RAM later. Also check out how much storage you want. I went for a 512 GB SSD configuration which is good enough,  but one can consider the 1 TB HDD and 256 GB SSD.."
5,"I was skeptical at first buying laptop from online shopping, but received it well packaged in carton box. Performance is good enough. Not producing much heat. Fan sound is also not audible. I recommend this one as it comes with optimized configuration."
3,Received my laptop 2 days back. It's avg looking laptop.Pro: a.Good configuration at given price for this brand.b. No over heating till date.c. Fingerprint is quick.Cons: a. keyboard casing is made of avg plastic material. Entire keyboard panel bends significantly when pressed from both corners^. I fear some day hinge will break out of this body pack.b. USB-C PD is mentioned but it's not letting me charge laptop with my superdart 65w mobile charger. Lenovo support are clueless of solution.
5,"In same budget HP was giving same configuration with 14"" but I went with 15.5"" and it is worth.Camera could had been better.Performance wise excellent."
4,"If you are interested in using some heavy softwares for engineering this will be an ideal laptop and can run these softwares smoothly and can run more than one software at once without much lag It's very comfortable to use.Light weight and boots very fast in a few secondsNowadays manufacturers are soldering the RAM slots , so if you are looking for a 16 GB configuration,this is a cheap alternative to the laptops which cost more than 1 lakhGraphics is not very good and so might not be suitable for gaming"
5,"Compact device with good screen size and clarity for work and academics. Appreciable processor and RAM speeds. Practically Light weight. Good variety of connections with USB and USB 3, HDMI, card readers etc. Original windows with upgrade option and MS office is good."
5,"Really very fast n sleek lappy. Likes: so sleek, wide display 15.6cm, Intel core i5 11th gen processor, only SSD in place of HDD making it even faster, fast fingerprint sensor, wifi 6, backlit keyboard, life time MS office 2019, upgraded to Windows 11 home in just 15 minutes, good for online classes and video editing, fast charging, power back up of up to 8 hours, and many more.Dislikes:- Absolutely nothing.An amazing purchase n very good packaging.

1,Amazon delivered the laptop which has warranty claimed. When checked for the warranty status it was showing less than 10 months remaining even though warranty was for 1 year. Better directly order from lenovo store or you can be cheated for a used product.
5,"Fast boot. Amazing auto start feature when opened up. Good 300 Nits FHD display Great Dolby sound quality. Nice shutter feature for camera. Lightweight.

4,"16 RAM ensures the topnotch speed of the processor which helps me navigate through many tabs. Gaming experience is bad at all. Other than that, the resolution of its screen is pretty good as well. The size of the screen is pretty decent as well. The keyboard functions more than adequate."

1,"My first buy of any Lenovo product and probably the last one....!!I'm writing this review after 3 months of use and believe me this doesn't deserve your hard earned money.After just a month's use I stared facing issue with USB ports, system getting crashed while working, keyboard/trackpad/entire device getting hanged all of a sudden and the only way out is to turn it OFF manually. The device also gets restarted automatically without any reason. Even after the device is SHUT DOWN I'm facing the issue of battery getting drained completely automatically.I've tried to receive support from Lenovo Technical Support team but they also failed to address the issues, as the issues keep on recurring even after the fixes every now and then.I also contacted Lenovo Customer Support Team for replacement of my product after like 50 days of usage as the issues were recurring evry now and then and the Technical Support Team wasn't able to resolve it permanently and believe me they have the worst Support Team. They are replying me that since the product is not meeting their DOA guidelines they won't be able to repalce it, and adivised me to contact their Technical Support Team for the issues.So, please guys don't waste your money on this product as Lenovo won't be able to provide you with appropriate support and neither will it address your greviances."
1,"Received damaged product. Selected replacement next day with techni visit schedule, no one came, tagged Amazonian on twitter, a call came, damage photo uploaded on link sent by Amazon, again tech visit scheduled, no one came. Replacement window over"
1,Just unpack and screen is smaller than shown in item description.No numpad.I3 instead of i5No fingerprint scanner.Scratch on outer bodyHave not on the laptop and reviewed the RAM and other details.Very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è
5,Super laptop Speed is very fast ‚è©
5,"One of the best laptops  . Love the build quality , fast boot thanks to the SSD.  Finger print sensor works great as well.Battery lasts easily 6-7 hours.Before buying check out the configurations as there are several  available.  Preferably buy one with the max RAM configuration as there is no option to upgrade RAM later. Also check out how much storage you want. I went for a 512 GB SSD configuration which is good enough,  but one can consider the 1 TB HDD and 256 GB SSD.."
5,"I was skeptical at first buying laptop from online shopping, but received it well packaged in carton box. Performance is good enough. Not producing much heat. Fan sound is also not audible. I recommend this one as it comes with optimized configuration."
3,Received my laptop 2 days back. It's avg looking laptop.Pro: a.Good configuration at given price for this brand.b. No over heating till date.c. Fingerprint is quick.Cons: a. keyboard casing is made of avg plastic material. Entire keyboard panel bends significantly when pressed from both corners^. I fear some day hinge will break out of this body pack.b. USB-C PD is mentioned but it's not letting me charge laptop with my superdart 65w mobile charger. Lenovo support are clueless of solution.
5,"In same budget HP was giving same configuration with 14"" but I went with 15.5"" and it is worth.Camera could had been better.Performance wise excellent."
4,"If you are interested in using some heavy softwares for engineering this will be an ideal laptop and can run these softwares smoothly and can run more than one software at once without much lag It's very comfortable to use.Light weight and boots very fast in a few secondsNowadays manufacturers are soldering the RAM slots , so if you are looking for a 16 GB configuration,this is a cheap alternative to the laptops which cost more than 1 lakhGraphics is not very good and so might not be suitable for gaming"
5,"Compact device with good screen size and clarity for work and academics. Appreciable processor and RAM speeds. Practically Light weight. Good variety of connections with USB and USB 3, HDMI, card readers etc. Original windows with upgrade option and MS office is good."
5,"Really very fast n sleek lappy. Likes: so sleek, wide display 15.6cm, Intel core i5 11th gen processor, only SSD in place of HDD making it even faster, fast fingerprint sensor, wifi 6, backlit keyboard, life time MS office 2019, upgraded to Windows 11 home in just 15 minutes, good for online classes and video editing, fast charging, power back up of up to 8 hours, and many more.Dislikes:- Absolutely nothing.An amazing purchase n very good packaging.

4,"It's been two weeks and having heart experience with this laptop.On time delivery and good service from Amazon.Laptop performance is very good.Price can be something in early 60k. But it's ok as we see there is hike in the market for all laptopsMany hot keys makes my life simpler, like calculator sniping volume controls etcThough it looks sleek, it's bit heavy to hold.Overall good to have personal laptop.I didn't use it for gaming so no views on that"
1,Amazon delivered the laptop which has warranty claimed. When checked for the warranty status it was showing less than 10 months remaining even though warranty was for 1 year. Better directly order from lenovo store or you can be cheated for a used product.
5,"Fast boot. Amazing auto start feature when opened up. Good 300 Nits FHD display Great Dolby sound quality. Nice shutter feature for camera. Lightweight. Core i5 11 gen processor, 16 GB Ram, 512 GB SSD, 2.4 GHz Freq. combination give ultimate performance. Good decision and happy with the purchase."

1,Laptop is not working
4,I got this on 4th November 2021 and after using it for 1 week this laptop is pretty fast and smooth. This is not for gaming... GTA V  can be played but the graphics are not good
4,"16 RAM ensures the topnotch speed of the processor which helps me navigate through many tabs. Gaming experience is bad at all. Other than that, the resolution of its screen is pretty good as well. The size of the screen is pretty decent as well. The keyboard functions more than adequate."

4,Hey it's ok u must buy it  well I like it reaaly much it's win 11 so yah its expensive
5,"After use of 5 days my observation is:1. Battery life 7-8 hours while doing multitasking with internetWhile havy load like Android development running multiple servers in local and working with 5-6 havy tools at same time 5-62.

3,"Did not meet expectations:Takes significant time to start since it first display logo of fijustu.The material around touch pad feels weak. This is where you would hold the device in your hands. Feels like it can break easily.Camera quality is poor. Also the physical camera shutter is very difficult to use and feels cheap.There are no support assistantance application available.You need to register for warrenty. Website is very confusing. You won't find your device easily.Faced a glitch while using MS office 19 later it go resolved.If it is placed on mattress and put on charging, fan would make a lot of noise and laptop would shutdown abruptly. It think there is problem with ventilation.Just by opening single chrome window, 4 GB of ram is utilised and cooling fan starts working heavily.The sound quality is poor.Best thing is it very light.I regret not going for LG Gram.Also, I have no idea where are their service centres. When I registered for warranty I got successful confirmation message from Lenovo."
1,"This laptop is great in terms of how light weight it is but I do not think this is a good laptop for business use. I have tried this for zoom calls but the speaker is pathetic and camera is even worse.. Very flimsy and has lot of flex. Keypad is not as good as you find on lenovo or hp. Tried my best to adjust but ultimately has to return it. The battery life is not that good. Just 4-5 hrs at the max.  Not sure what Japanese tech went into this laptop, this feels like any other cheap Chinese laptop."
5,First day of using this laptopIt‚Äôs damn fast and the keypad is smooth to operate.Great display of craftsmanship.Bravo Japanese. Really it‚Äôs cut above all other manufacturers
4,I seek Warranty Certificate of 2 years as in Site as decalared in the site while buying
5,The laptop has great built with all the required specs and ultra light in weight. Battery is also great for people looking for full day battery backup.Track Pad can be improved upon in next version.Overall a great package for people who are looking for ultra light laptop with long battery
5,"Very light, fast and cute. If the size was 14 inch, it would have been better. Good value for money"
5,Ultra light and pretty fast! The laptop is very handy and looks very delicate.. needs to be handled carefully! Got the Windows 11 upgrade immediately on connecting to the internet. Enjoying the experience..
4,Laptop is awesome but speaker was really bad.... People with big fingers will have a big problem. People with hearing problem will have a problem with laptop speakers.
5,"No comparison at all, the quality and peace of mind for everything, it's Made in Japan and it makes you feel that. Go for it blindly, you will not regret spending few thousands extra as compared to any other brand.Its a love at first sight."
5,It is a light weight power house in terms of performance. Did not like the placement of keys PgUp & PgDn and Home & End buttons. Rest all absolutely perfect.
5,"I have been using this laptop for 7 days for programming small projects and it functioning smoothly. According to my experience, it's better than other famous brands."
3,"The speakers and sound quality are pathetic and poor. The speed is highlighted, and the visuals are perfect. Just the speakers to avoid!"
5,Lighter than a tab with a solid build quality.
5,Very very light and made in japan
4,Soo compact lightweight
5,Price is high for this. It can be 50k if possible.
5,Lovely laptop. Very well built. Beautiful display and very very light. Only con is that it does not have thunderbolt support.
5,"Value for money product, Japanese trust, light weight, does the job according to specifications."
4,wonderful product. feather lite. awesome.
4,Battery life could be improved
1,"I had bought this laptop considering that it is being manufactured by a Japanese company as they are the pioneers in technology and deliver quality products.But on the contrary, my decision of buying this Laptop is regretful. In a months time I started facing issues in speakers and there was blue screen error every now and then. The service centre located at Jail road Delhi had kept my laptop for more than 15 days, but the issue is not resolved till date. There is no escalation matrix wherein your complaints can be put forward.Pathetic servicing by the centre as they are not aware of the processes. Parts availability is another major concern.GUYS PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY FUJITSU LAPTOP."
2,"Overpriced for this mediocre product with no brand value, better to check out other products in reputed brands like dell, Hp, Asus"
3,For just i5 11th gen this laptop is way overpriced. At this price you can get a descent gaming laptop with full size keyboard and better specifications especially in terms of CPU and GPU. For gaming laptops checkout ArshWood on YT. This laptop is not worth it.

1,Dont buy this product...hang issu ..not better performace...so dont buy this product its very bad and chip quality material used
5,"This laptop is very good for personal and student use. I've been using WhatsApp Google meet and various other apps on it and it's been working nice. Moreover the screen quality is nice, the camera is also good ,enough for a laptop at this price.Although the battery is not that good, maybe I'm feeling that cause I use internet alot. But as the I would say you should go for it. It's a great buy."
5,"Its beast, it's best in every aspect for a computer science student + Gamer. Super fast CPU beats M1 in turbo mode, high refresh rate clubed with RTX 3060 is like driving a Maserati while doing heavy gaming or working on Android Studio. When doing only coding and net surfing battery can last upto 8-10 hrs. Only one of the down grade you can say it's a display with low brightness, but that hardly matters to me as in indoor conditions it's awesome. Just go for its it's the best price laptop with this specs (1tb SSD+ RTX 3060 + I7 11800H (8C,16T) ,16g Ram)"
5,"Great product by asus, it lives upto the mark, I have tested it on on all the AAA titles like far cry 6, cyberpunk 2077, Forza horizon 5 and I got a constant of 60fps. The processor is a beast. The heat sinks are truly powerful and keep the laptop cool for significant amount of time. If u have money just go for it no questions asked."
5,The Laptop works as smoothly as a well-oiled machine. The build is sturdy and doesn't get too hot. The performance is excellent and the display is beautiful.
5,100% recommend for Game lover. Best budget gaming Laptop. Love it
5,Very few gaming laptops come with 3060 at this price point that too with an i7...also this is the 2021 addition so the heating is not problematic in this one and of course the thunderbolt is cherry on top.
5,"I researched for a budget-friendly laptop for over a month and after juggling between different brands and models, I finalized this one. Trust me, I am not at all disappointed. This is one of the best laptops out there. The best part is it comes with a 2-year warranty. And, you know if the company is providing you with a 2-year warranty then your product will stay safe for at least 3-4 years.Amazing Touch. Amazing Screen. Smooth Keyboard.I have an eye condition because of which it's quite hard for me to focus but this laptop has made my life easy. I swear if your budget is 40-50k, go for it. You won't regret buying it.I bought a keyboard cover and a sleeve too just for extra protection but I don't think there's any drawback that I've noticed to date."
1,"I ordered 2 laptop for my kids exams, but to my disappointment one of the laptop (Lenovo) was dead on arrival. Called up Customer care, they said technician will visit, but again none of the technician visited & the audacity of the person, he reported laptop is now in working condition. I called up the technician he said Ma'am the service is not possible, bcoz the technician person is from Karnataka & the service required is in Maharashtra. All the above drama happened twice, arranging for new technician & so on.... Now with kids exams going on... I have to chase the Customer care again  & everytime I am connected to a new person, have to explain the whole story again. Then I requested them for return/refund. They agreed.... After 3 days the delivery boy comes & say that the laptop is not in working condition, I cannot take back, u talk to customer care.... I called up again the customer care a new pick up was arranged after 3days, again the same thing happened. Height of disappointment, chasing for your own money.. it's been roughly 15 to 18 days i have been calling the customer care, everytime the response is Positive,they say that they will do the needful, but just lying.

5,"Is a very good system indeed, you can use it as your daily driver. Tried running good number of programs but the backside to it, no modifications can be done. Pre installed RAM of 8GB, 512 GB M.2 Gives lighting fast speed. But I would appreciate if I could install another SSD"

Sleek and compact.Pros:Backlit keyboardFingerprintScreen is brilliantSound is okDual channel 3200mhz ram (8gb)ConsDefinitely Not lightweightGets warm at base.. you can feel it if kept on lap. it can be a good thing as heat dissipation works.Charger port is not USB cBattery life is 4-5 hrs of watching movie or binging. But quick charge covers this drawback. 0-60% in an hr.Overall it's excellent for the price. (44k)Please don't compromise on quality for price. This laptop has good built quality and provides 2 yr warranty.Go for it blindly.

Fingerprint reader7. SSD storage8. Privacy shutter in webcam9. TWO YEARS OF WARRENTY!!!Cons:1. Just above avg battery life2. i3 is better for battery life if you're light to medium user but i5 would be better choice if you are into gaming or rendering stuff"
5,"It's a power packed product windows 10 home, office 2019, 8gb ram, 11th gen i3, 256gb ssd, aesthetics look, finger print recognition, steel body, camera shutter @43990/- value for money"
1,Product is fine but it is annoying the way Amazon has NOT fulfilled the bundled offers like free Hungama subscription etc on Laptop during Festival sale even after followup and sharing screenshots of their own commitment. Moreover their customer team is passing parcel within themselves to further disappoint you. NOT EXPECTED OF AMAZONUpdate 2 Dec: still Amazon continues to runaway with execuses on their committed offer post followups. Below expectations
1,I bought this laptop and it's display was defective it doesn't got on I asked Amazon to replace and they took more than 20 days to and even after 20 days they refunded me didn't given replacement. I have to call Amazon costumer care daily for more than 20 days it's very bad experience with Amazon
5,"Writing this review nearly after 20 days of use.Overall the laptop is good.Delivery was on time.No lag while using as 8gb ram, i3 processor and 256gb ssd does it's job quite well.Mainly i use it for Documents(not to forget MS office is included) and Browsing and battery backup is around 7-8 hrs and it does charge fast. Sound quality is average and screen brightness is kind of okay so not to expect more.It would have been better if there was an ethernet port."
5,Best product in this value range. The screen size may be little small for people used to working in 15 inch laptops but over time one gets adjusted to 14 inch screen. It's super light and easy to carry around.Laptop boots up literally in seconds and the response time is superfast. A good value addition. Also was able to  update warranty start date to delivery date and get complete 24 months warranty coverage.
1,"Recording / micro phone issue less than a month . Contacted Amazon for replacement , but I was informed to contact Lenevo for service / warranty. Disappointed with this issues"
5,"7 hrs battery life,1.4 kg weight,with i3 intel processor 11gen MSO backlit/finger print reader 256gb SSD is okey and price reasonable. Thanks Amazon"
4,"The laptop is very good with fast processing, thanks to its SAMSUNG NVMe SSD and 8gb 3200MHz RAMTrack pad can be slightly better (not faced any major issue)Comes with genuine Windows 10 and MS officeDisplay is awesomeThe only cons of this product is it's battery. It lasts only for around 3 hr not as much it claims."
4,"Basic MS office work (Excel, powerpoint) , checking emails, browsing, SSD makes it boot much faster..overall great value for money"
5,Good one with good battery life and sound quality is very good and bootup is very fast good one..
5,Used 8 thinkpads since 2001 and 1st time want to try non thinkpad. This product is light weight and as of now battery life is at par with Thinkpad... overall very happy with this product
1,Worst Acer Laptop
5,"Good Laptop, thin and light with latest intel processor and good battery life. Completely worth buying at this price range."
5,This laptop is very goodGood speedLight weight so easy to carry around5 hours battery back up with normal work
1,There is a problem with the screen of the laptop. Returned the first one and the same issue came for the 2nd one as well. The screen becomes blurred occassionally
4,Good Quality lenevo laptop V15
2,We need to BOYCOTT New Laptop RETAILERS/ MANUFACTURER due to following reasons:1. Laptops dont have DVD or BluRay Drive due to which we need to download Content using OUR OWN INTERNET SERVICE which is CHARGABLE.2. Laptops have Battery which is not changeable hence for battery we need to visit service center @ our cost we need to change LAPTOP BATTERY.3. Few Laptops manufacturer Fix the RAM to MOTHERBOARD such that customers can't UPGRADE Laptop Parts & Investing again HUGE COST ENFORCING customers to BUY A NEW LAPTOP.
5,"Wanted to give review as I had spent considerable time looking for a new laptop. They were either too pricey or lacked desired features.Had earlier put couple of other laptops in cart, but Amazon used to inform of price change within 6 hours.Received this laptop today.First impressions :Good looksLight weightLooks sturdy but plan to get a sleeve to provide more protectionCame well packed by HP. However, Amazon used a bigger box so it was moving around.No heating issuesSIM slot works wellRemoved bloatwareUpdated WindowsAll ok till now, after 8 hours.Will again update after a few weeksGood buy.Received this laptop trust"
4,"I love the 14' screen size, the processor is great. The initialisation process is very user friendly and does not take much time. The slot for the sim card is definitely a plus. Keyboard feels dainty initially but then you get used to it. The backlight was on during the initialisation, however figuring out how it gets activated during low light/night.Struggled a bit with McAfee account but all good in the end.Wish next time we are provided with a feature to segment the single ssd drive (pardon my ignorance).Not a deal breaker but the description says 'Pre-installed Microsoft Office Home & Student 2019', ...well the fact is that the software is there without the activation code. I would have given a 5 star else please edit the description accordingly.Not a gamer, so cant comment on its gaming capabilities. However, I gather it should not lag for light to medium games. Could be an issue with heavy games.Bloat apps can be done away with."
5,Good
5,"Satisfied with performance, excellent product"
5,"Very good laptop for HP. And 4G LTE Port is superb feature. Start & shutdown is very fast, locking is good. Overall good product and highly recommended for students, always connect internet anywhere.."

4,Very initial view.Pluses:1. Finger print scanner at this price2. Office H+S is licensed alongwith Win 10.3. Slot to put additional hard disk. It can be another ssd as well. They have provided the kit for it as well.4. Super fast boot due to ssd. Under 5 secs.Minuses:1. Keyboard is not back-lit2. Characters on a silver keyboard are written in grey... Why?3. Screen is strictly average... 7/10. Especially when you are used to rich colours on the smartphones nowadays.4. Camera is a hopeless vga. Not good for zoom calls.Will update review again later.
1,It's a decent laptop with upgradable memory and RAM ....but the only drawback is webcam and lot of hanging problem...in this budget that can't be tolerated ...
1,"Not expected as it was told by the amazon , display was not ips and speakers were defective .."
1,"1st laptop came it start hanging on 4th day on 5 day it hangged, raised replacement request. Replacement came on 30th April. This laptop get hangged on 9th day. Since then it get hangged on every 3rd or 4th day. Earlier it was giving good backup of around 6 to 6:30 hrs it was consuming 80% battery. From last 7 to 8 days I am seeing that  it is consuming 80% battery in around 4 hrs and even taking more time on charging. I only use it for office work no games no and I didn't even used it's space of 0.25 gb. This is my one month review.It's my mistake that I bought Asus laptop. A very big mistake."
5,"During first use , i faced some issues with the laptop and I reported the matter to Amazon customer service .But after several updates, the issues solved and now I am satisfied with the performance ( Office Use )of the Laptop . Good Battery Back up, Light weight, Good for using MS office. Screen clarity is Average, But overall Ok for the price."
1,"From day one this laptop is heating excessively and not able to touch on it at the side of heating. Still Amazon customer care is not accepting request for return, They are asking us to reinstall BIOS. Why didnt they install everything properly before delivery.  We are not computer experts and Amazon is trying to avoid return of defective product."

4,The product is extremely awesome.But it heats a lot while using.
4,"Slightly disappointed üòû because display is not very good, brightness is slightly lowBut overall performance is best.Fingerprint sensor is also very fast ‚è©.The Keyboard has number key also."
1,"They cheated me for Rs. 90000, please dont waste your money on this garbage product. Better buy Dell or HP or anyother than Asus"
4,It is a awesome laptop but the only problem is speakers. The sound is very low.And ya sometimes hangs
5,"Fantastic Laptop,Best Laptop under 40k, I contact dell web for delivery but they take minimum 4days of delivery, so I finally purchased on Amazon as same rate as dell website and I received this product on next day,Very good Laptop, i3 10th gen -4GB-250GBM2 type SSD & light weightDue to SSD Boot time is only 8-9 Sec. & Shutdown time takes only 3Sec. 170GB available for Use.You also add SATA Type HDD/SDD (Slot available for this)Windows 10Home & MS-Office home & student (word-excel-Power point) available with this, simple you need to create MS office registration for activation.Display quality is very good and remain same in different angle.Battery Backup is almost 4 to 5hrs, and charger is 45W Fast.Only C type port is not available,I recently updated Windows 10 & Bios, no fan noise is coming from it( Before Update & after Update) Overall Good Product Go for it....."

5,The laptop so far had been really good especially for it's working.. I recommend you to buy this compelling laptop!
1,"Received worst product from Amazon ever.. I purchase a dell inspiron15 i3 laptop , and I got laptop with windows 10 pirated version , also having major screen problem..."
3,"Its been an month, continuously using it non stop.For office work its fine, but for students its over priced, as light muti-video editing very easily heats up the laptop and fast drainage. i.e;. Normal Battery Standby mode lasts for 4 to 6 hrs and  8 to 12 hours when kept open( if no apps running in battery save mode and dimmed).. Videos play around 2 to 3 hrs if fully charged..No keyboard light, cannot use outdoor in dark places.. No fingerprint sensors..ROM is low..Bad laptop for gaming..even angry bird game heats it up very easily. Some games run but i would personally not recommend to use it..Faster Boots of 10 to 12 sec (in compare to SDD).Fast screen shut down in 2 sec and overall 4 to 5 sec to full shutdown from inside till re-press power button to start up..Ram upto 1.5gb always in use. 3gb if use means confirm heatup. I would not hold it in my lap..Very good for MS office works and Browsing with good touch gestures.SO ITS DEPENDs ON HOW YOU would use THE APPS. Its a good built laptop. . 32- 35000 rupees i would rate it at maximum..or opt to buy a laptop with better processor.. I have deducted the star because there is no servicing in my area and over price hike in recent month. Its september 2021. But Good laptop."
4,"Pros: Fit for online learning and documentation. Good display and touch. Nice browsing experience. Quick booting and good sound and speaker. Wifi goodRj4 is there, we can connect it to the direct cableCons:Not at all fit for heavy software duty like coding and running heavy applications on this. But fine if you connect to your remote machines like lvdis and cloud.Do not consider this for games even in dreams.I ran few performance tests, here the details out of 10 scale.CPU : 9Memory: 5 -- it's due to 4Gb and 250gb disk."
1,"Bought this once, the headphone jack stopped working, ordered a replacement, the mic in the headphone jack was not working, tried to suck it up and use it anyway since work was more important. Two weeks later, guess what, headphone jack stopped working completely. Again. Never buying Dell ever again."
4,Best laptop in this price for normally users.

5,Superb laptop for home and students
5,This is best Laptop in this price.
5,Great one. Go for it
1,Laptop started giving issues within 2 weeks. What I feel more concerned about is the lack of ownership displayee by both Amazon and Dell.
5,"Interestingly I did not buy it for gaming purpose at all. but for purely academic, where extensive drafting work plus online lecture was required.The size of laptop is hardly little more than the std 15.6inches screen laptop so no issue with the bulkiness but better screen area utilisation. Multiple window work is easily doable.Screen is glare free and easy on eyes,Battery life not an issue as you can adjust the refresh rate and brightness etc and enhance.The deal was superb and unmissable on account of exchange offer.Overall good deal and it served well my purpose."
5,I am not a gamer and it's my first time using a gaming laptop. Before I was on to an low performance one with just 4 gb ram and so... Back then i was dreaming of playing GTA 5 and froza horizon and i had fulfilled it through YouTube. But now I can play what ever shit I want and gives me a different feel of gaming. I regret I was too late on to msi gf series and surely will buy one for my best friend.. Thanks msi for providing this budget friendly gaming beast and supporting new gamers like me.. Iam loving it
5,"I got this laptop under 61k and I love this laptop, it's just amazing, solid bulid quality, looks simply sexy, very smooth as well as fast and it's 144hz screen was cherry on cake but it feels quite heavy otherwise it's an amazing laptop.

There are other options in it too. Webcam is decent enough.Now come to battery- It frighteningly drains fast if you play games in extreme performance mode. My 10 years old son once played Asphalt9. The gaming experience to him was excellent but 20 minutes of playing consumes 50% of battery. Although there are ways to save battery charge.Keyboard is fine. Touchpad is little shaky. I don't konw if it's a good or bad things for gamers. Build quality is good enough for me.Overall, it's a good laptop in around 60k. The seller Apario retail is also good and trustworthy.  My suggestion, if your budget permits then go for it. Do not buy 15.6 inch laptop. 17.3 inch will give you vast space which is very comfortable for multitasking."

4,"I got my ThinkPad E14 Ryzen 3 5300 yesterday, ie, 15 October 2021. It is the gen 3 model. Came with Win 10 and MS office pre-installed. 8Gb ram with 250Gb SSD. Upgraded to Win 11 today. Apart from an occasional slightly sluggish trackpad, rest of the system functions well. Keyboard is quite good. The laptop is well built with no flexing. It is compact for the screen size, but on the heavy side, okay considering the build quality. Considering the price of ‚Çπ38600 paid after discounts, I consider it an excellent value for money. The T series ThinkPads are better, but is very expensive."
5,"I got my laptop a week ago. I bought it for Rs.38,800.It is the ThinkPad E14 gen3  with AMD Ryzen 3 5300U/14"" FHD TN panel/8GB RAM/256GB SSD/Windows 10/MS Office. I have been using it extensively for a week. So here is my review...PROS:1. It has Ryzen 3 5300U which is faster than 10th gen intel i5. As the ryzen 5000 series CPUs are of 7nm it has better thermal and power efficiency than intel 11gen cpus.2. RAM and SSD are from SK HYNIX.3. Best build quality in this segment (All plastic).4. It has the best laptop KEYBOARD I have ever seen (but no backlit).5. Thermals of this laptop is well contained...Thanks to RYZEN, and the fan is super silent.6. Battery life is around 5-6hrs when browsing and watch movies and it charges back really quick because of 65wh charging.7. Comes with windows 10 and ms office 2019 se with lifetime validity.8. Has slots to upgrade RAM and SSD.CONS:1. TN panel...but this is not really a con. because I knew what I was getting...At this price you will not get a good laptop with a good IPS panel.TIPS:-- With default settings the display colour looks faded or in other words the colours look more natural... If you want more vivid display like we are used to--Open AMD Radeon software-go to DISPLAY tab- enable Custom color- and increase the saturation according to your eyes...That it...and one more useful tip for those who have read my review-- When you buy any new laptop, first make a backup image of your new laptop with any backup software, I used Macrium reflect. You should do this  even before connecting to the Internet. This backup image will come in handy in future...tY...have a nice day..."
5,"Bought the 3rd Gen E14, it came with Ryzen 5 5300U. Bought this from other account. It's very lightweight, excellent build quality, the display is good, amazing battery life and the fan is so silent you'll have to put your ears close enough to hear it spin. Its a bit fingerprint magnet if your hands are sweaty or oily. The nvme is very quick compared to my old SATA SSD. The extra slot will recognise only nvme and not the SATA SSD. Processor itself is very fast given I don't game on it. It came with windows 10 and MS office student which activates with Microsoft account. I switched to Ubuntu 20.04.3 ASAP and made it even faster. Fingerprint reader won't work on Linux but other things work really well. Go for it if you're a programmer/internet surfer/casual gamer/office worker."

5,its good and compatible
4,Nice product
5,"Speed , look and light weight.  Very good product"

1,Backlit keyboard not availableProcessor speed is 2.4GhzNot satisfied

1,Disappointment üòî. This laptop have no backlit keyboard
4,No dvd drive .. rest of all good
1,The key features say that the laptop has a backlit key board whereas the product delivered doesnt have a backlit keyboard. NOT AT ALL VALUE FOR MONEY. BE sure to check the specifications on the DELL Website before buying.P.S. This particular model doesnt exist on the DELL Website
4,Excellent laptop for the price. Doesn't have backlit keyboard as mentioned in the description.  It's misleading..... the answers given to the questions are conflicting....Amazon should ensure correct description is given
4,"Light weight,nice design but has no cd drive and also doesn't come with a bag.Also there is no licensed ms-office given in this laptop"
5,"Value product , good features"
5,Excellent laptop with premium quality... What a speed and performance  very happy to share review ... Thank you AsusOLED display is superb
5,Best laptop in this price segment.Also
4,It's a very good laptop for basic computer tasks and media consumption thanks to its OLED display. I upgraded to windows 11 which btw is free. The only con with this laptop is it's battery life. If you are ok with your laptop plugged in most of the time then it shouldn't be a problem. Final verdict. Recommended at this price.
5,Camera quality could have been better. Too much pixelated at low light.Positions of charge slot could have given other sides.The post slot could have equally distributed left and right
5,There is nothing bad about this product at 46k price bracket. For general purposes no laptop can beat this product.
5,Excellent display quality.  Can see the difference immediately.  Soothing for eyes as well. Boots up quickly as well. No issues till now.
4,This lap will be adoptable for Document work not for heavy usage
5,"Super fast delivery by Amazon! Love the sleek design on this laptop. The display puts a cherry on the cake!! Great performance, super fast..!!"
2,There is dent on laptop box as well on laptop. Not sure whether it is due to bad packaging or manufacturing defect. A bit confused

5,"- I am using this laptop for about 15 days and if you need a future-proof laptop then this is the one.- The best part is the thermal system of this laptop, literally, this laptop doesn't heat up which definitely extends the life your laptop.- Almost all software available in the market is optimized to give the best performance with Intel processors and here you got the latest 11 generation intel i5 Hexa core processor.- The build quality is best, the design is awesome and the performance is powerful.- The typing experience you will get on this laptop is simply fabulous, better than Legion and Tuf laptop.- You can easily open the laptop lid with a single hand.- I use MATLAB and some CAD Softwares on this laptop which works very smoothly without any issue.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop. It lasts around 3 to 4 hrs for multitasking and heavy work.- Recently, I have upgraded my laptop to windows 11 which is working fine.- The battery life is not that good as it is a gaming laptop."
1,I got a faulty product the charger wasn‚Äôt working and i ordered the 1tb 256ssd variant but i got 512ssd variant delivered which was faulty even thou on my invoice it mentioned the 1tb variant.
5,one of the best thermals out there intels new Alder Lake CPU with Nvidia RTX 3050 for smooth gamingpersonally using it and liked it so muchJust add another ssd for even better performance
5,Best gaming laptop in this range even after long hours of gaming it does not get much heated like the other laptops.  The display is amazing for gaming. Does not get heated fast can play for 3 to 4 hours without it getting heated.  Comfortable keyboard for gaming. The battery life is excellent for gaming laptop. I thought my charger was not working so I got in touch with the customer care and they were super helpful resolved my issue immediately actually the charger had to be pushed all the way it is a double push when it connects we hear a click sound.
5,"Loved this Laptop, Simply Amazing, Go for it"
5,"BATTERY IS A BIT LOW COMPARED TO OTHERS OF SAME PRICE BUT HDD AND SSD COMBO MAKES UP FOR THE LOSS, THERMALS ARE AWESOME.SERIOUSLY GO FOR IT IF YOU WANT BEST RTX 3050 LAPTOP, EVEN THOUGH THE TGP OF THE GPU IS A BIT LOWER THAN THE ROG STRIX G15, THE PERFORMANCE IS TOO BIG. HENCE GO FOR IT."
5,"Worth the money, if anybodys laptop is unable to charge up, remember to push the pin inside the charger port all the way in."

5,Love the Laptop. If you're looking for an excellent gaming laptop under 70k this is the best choice.
5,Good laptop at this range. Laptop speed is fentastic. And looking good with rgb keyboard and the buttons of keyboard are also good.
4,"Go for it, it's a nice pick."
3,"I am writing this review after about 1 month of usage. The specs can be looked at in the description. So, I will tell about the problems only. The keyboard spacing is not good. You will need time to get used to it. I am a programmer by profession. So, even though I know the key placements, typing errors are frequent. Touchpad's build quality doesn't look good. Also one needs to pick up the laptop with both hands, otherwise, some issues arise (like fan making noise). This laptop attracts dust, so need some measures for that also (keyboard cover). The battery is average (wouldn't have expected much as it is a performance-oriented laptop and 60Hz minimises the battery consumption). Many times, only 2 USB ports can be used (has 3 ports, but 2 are very close). The power point at the back also creates an issue (one needs to be extra cautious while charging). Sometimes, it gets heated even while using a browser and a media player and file explorer opened. So, it is an average product."
5,"Push charging pin through it will work , everything is fine in laptop nice  deal  good laptop üëç üëç üëç"
5,"1. First at all to every one i want to say do not think about bad reviews for this laptop because those bad reviews is not for its laptop those are 11300H which is 4 core 8 thread.And other for who got defective product (it is main reason for bad reviews) .2. Before buying this laptop i had done lots of research, wathing lots of video and the end i am confused with two processor amd (ryzen 5 5600H 6C 12T) and intel (i5-11400H 6C 12T in this laptop)CONCLUSION (this new intel processor beats  ryzen processor ) so that's why i choose this one.  ***************** Now about this laptop **************1. Everything awesome just go for it blindly.2. Performance 5/5. (base clock 2.7 and upto 4.5 ) ( 6 Core 12 Thread thanks god) ( Chace memory L1 480 KB, L2 7.5 MB, L3 12 MB always remember L1 chace is most speed ,powerful and costly)3. Display 5/5. (144 Hz)4. Build quality 5/5.5. Thunderbolt 4 and its wifi speed is fantastic (advantage..)6 Battery 5/4. (because it is gaming laptop always play game while charging it will give more performance and save your battery life.)7. Speaker 5/4. (yaa speakers is little bit low, but  you can  increase speakers volume by its dts software.)8. it's actual weight is 2.3 Kg not 2.4 i saw on acer offical site."
1,"I am highly disappointed with the product, the first time I got a faulty product it did not even start, after replacement the second one which was suppose to be 1 TB HDD but was only 500 GB.misleading information on the Amazon page.Waiting for my refund and return. I do not TRUST them anymore."
5,"Speed Performance is awesome.. sound average. Looks is good .. camera is bad, bad means bad. Plustic build..."
5,"Good Laptop, Fast finger print sensor boots fast thanks to SSD, at this price range Good for basic day to day work.Mine, Sliver coloured is a finger print magnet, it should have been a Matt finish.MSOffice365 is a trial version- 5days free usage, after that it requires purchase."
5,Installation was worst..he just switched on and  logged in..i wanted to know about laptop storage etc...he dont know anything about also internal hdd apparatus was given i asked him he told go to service center and i asked about antivirus installation he told 1 month is free after that u can get..so do i have to pay for installation again..why did he come than
5,good one.. booting time also fast.. inbuild ms office
5,I like this product so much The keyboard is very smoot and it's processor is very good. I am using it last 1 month and every time my family member used. It will shut only at night. And we will start working on it from 9 am in the morning
5,This is a wonder piece and perfect quality product. I recommend it fully.
5,Just go for this laptop.....as it is solid slim and thin laptop in this price range....just ignore everything nd go for it .....totally satisfied
2,"no ethernet, no backlit keyboard, flickering screen, waste of money...."

1,Battery backup nit good
5,Hiii its such really goob laptop pls chose this laptop for codingLet youBuyKkByyy...
1,Pathetic laptops. Pathetic service. Never trust asus. Never buy from these cheats. Bought vivobook S15. Motherboard faulty just after warranty period. Faulty sound. Faulty battery and power section. You buy this product at your own risk.
1,Product descriptions shows MS office is free but I cannot get key details though I had tried n no of times via customer care.I need key details on priority so help me how to get it.
5,"This is a decent machine with all the features required for an working professional just the sound is average...It's light weight , small and compact which makes it best in its range ...Just go for it...Best machine by asus"
1,Is there anything to like? Defective and refurbished items are sold on amazon. It is useless product. Never buy anything from this site
4,This review is written after one week of use. Overall the product is best to use. Display is perfect. Battery life can be improved. I gets around 5 hrs on average continuous use. sound system can be much better. Camera quality is below average.
1,"Got the faulty laptop with display bleeding issue.First impressions:If you're think this is an ultra book, you ar wrong. Its quite thick and heavy. Completely made of plastic. Atleast for me the laptop frizzed couple of times. Camera is awful. Keyboard feedback 0, could have been beter.Asked Amazon for replacement, for the screen issue, not sure what is wrong with them, they are sending technician and then they will decide.Verdict: i would prefer to get refund as i feel in this prolice range you can get better build and quality laptopUpdate with the replacement laptop as on 16th Ocr 21:The replacement laptop is also defective. Same issue with the screen. I'm returning the laptop and getting refund."
1,"Very poor camera quality and not satisfied with this laptop performance. Amazon not specified about camera details in their website, manufacturer cheated amazon, amazon cheated customer."
3,Been using this for about 3 weeks now. Product looks good in pics but is a bit flimsy and very basic audio quality. I had bought this for online schooling purposes but laptop speakers are barely loud to hear the teachers voice so o am having to use additional speakers to solve the issue. Wonder why laptop makers go so miserly on such basic things. I can understand we cannot expect a BnO level audio but even boat speakers are better!!However the god points being the hardware confit which gives u ssd and hdd so start up is quick. In summary:Pros:1. Good ssd and hdd configuration will give you faster speeds2. Built in office package3. 3 USB ports and type c connectivity4. I5 processor at high clock speedsCons:1. Pricing could be much  lower given the overall package i bought it for base price of about 55k2. Plastic buddy not very sturdy. I have a Lenovo ideapad which is also plastic but much sturdier than this3. Below average audio4. Very average webcam5. Below par  Audio and video combination kill the basic purpose of online schooling
3,"7Day use:Pros: superfastSmooth keyboardWindows 11 updateSharecam app for webcam (substitute of poor VGA webcam)fast deliveryMc Afee 1 year ( Not mentioned in specs)Cons: Corner glow is present, (Asus says it is vommon phenomenon of IPS LCD Display)No Backlit keyboardOnly Single color availble for purchase.Sound is lowNo SD card slotBattery maximum 3 hrs.Eye care mode not greatOnce after upgrade to windows 11 outlooks app disappearedVivobook Ultra is best compared to this.Take Extended warranty from my asus app after purchase cost is low...1699/- 2nd year."
3,1  Speaker and mic volume is too low and cannot use for online classes if you want avoid using headphones.2. The keyboard keys are not clear and letters printed not clear in normal light. Its difficult to use this laptop if user does not know typing.3. The camera resolution is too low  and not even worth for zoom meeting.
4,"Good laptop. A combination of SSD and HDD at this price range. Start up and shutdown is lightning fast due to SDD but then the laptop itself is slow from day 1 so HDD I guess is not quite up to the mark.Screen quality is goodSize and weight of the laptop is perfect.If you need it for casual work (i.e. some non office work), daily browsing, some light movie and gaming, then this is a perfect laptop."
3,"Received a defective product. Got dead after 36 hours. Requested for refund, but got an replacement next day.The replacement product is ok. Got the window 11 on same day. Camera is very poor in this model. Face detection not supported. Key board colour combination is also not good. Almost invisible keys. Otherwise the laptop is very fast & ok for everyday jobs."
5,"I was skeptic buying laptop online, but Amazon has never disappointed me yet.Asus was amazingly great! This is my first laptop of this brand, I was not sure but this is a top level laptop. Smooth and advanced with lots of space and good for gaming, but as I don't play much games so I am not gonna say more on gaming!"
1,"Awful amazon service. Ordered this laptop on 6thoct, received a faulty piece which didnt switch on at all. Been calling for replacement/return continuously. Not yet happened. Horrible experience"
5,I wish it was little more faster. Otherwise it's very good Laptop and value for money.
3,It's good backup Good screen size Good there is no LAN port . If they provide bag and screen clear jel this is to good. If 5k down price it's too good I bought in 55k I think so 48k 50 is the it's perfect price
4,4.5 STAR ... Lacking 2 important features that MUST be included .... backlit keyboard & card reader
5,Excellent laptop with good processor.processing speed is nice.all features are nice.internet a bit slow
4,Everything is up to the mark with this price except Camera Quality
3,Sound quality is not good‚Ä¶ even at maximum setting very less sound
4,EXCELLENT!
1,No charger

4,"I ordered this laptop on 06 Oct 2021.Display quality- 8/10keyboard - 5/10performance - 9/10Battery Life-  as of today- 7/10 (need to use if for atleast a month or two then will update the review)OS, Software- 8/10Amazon deal- 9/10Camera quality- 2/10Customisation- 7/101.Original price is 66k, Got this for 39K, in exchange of my 10 years old asus i3 2nd gen laptop (9K value) in Amazon festival with other HDFC offers.Laptop is fast, as it is i5 11th Gen. and 8 GB ram with 256ssd HD.2. I tried looking for it's reviews and photos all over internet but didnt find any proper pic or review of exactly this model even on website.3. So the keyboad is not backlit keyboard. Its only chicklet keyboard and I am nt happy with the way it is. at this cost they could have provided backlit keyboard. Also in the product images on amazon glowing logo on keyboard is shown, and since it is 2021, I thought this must be having backlit keyboard. And the colour of letters and numbers is grey on silver keys, this combination is not good from viewing angle.4. Laptop doesnt fill that light weight, it must be weighing around 1.8 kg.5. Performance is good as of now. Installing apps , working fine. did nt try heavy apps yet.  shall update it's review after some time.6. There is no memory card reader slot in this laptop. There is no indication on front , if laptop is starting after u press the power button- this is absolutly rubbish. You will come to knw only whn ur screen will be on. else keep looking on side edge of laptop.7. Display quality is amazing. I am enjoying it.8. Laptop came with windows 10 and office and MCaffe for 1 year preinstallled. Happy to use it.9. Got a good deal, wait for few more reviews. then decide in next amazon festival.10. Laptop boots very fast. and the fingerprint scanner works amazing, responce is quick."
4,"I bought this laptop üíª  from dell store near me,Pros:*11th gen i5 with iris graphics.*256gb ssd along with 1tb HDD, 8gb ram*boots very fast andCons:*plastic build*Not suitable for heavy gaming*Charging"
1,Never expect this type of  product from dellOnly 8 days after receiving the product. Laptop is getting hanged and not starting now. The replacement date is gone yesterday.  Though I was getting same configuration from differnet brand at lower price. I went ahead and purchsed with trust from Dell.No option is there to put 0 star else i could have gave 0 star.
4,Got it in good condition and after using a week i can say its good... All things working fine... Battery life if around 4 hours with WiFi connected... I'll review this again if anything bothers me... So for now a deal for 55k is good
5,"The laptop is good. Using it for almost a month, it's little bit heavy but that is what the Dell Inspiron 15 series is known for.The battery life is good.. last for almost 6 hours. The screen is of 15"" and full hd quality.With SSD C:, the boot time is very less and it instantly boots up."
4,"Pros: Reasonable at this price rangeEasy installation,Online Dell and Microsoft support,Good speed and enough memory.Great screen resolution,Adjustable light sensitivity,Cons: A bit heavy,The battery lasts only 3,1/2hours and charges slowly.Updates keep pooping almost every day."
1,"Though the manufacturer was mentioned to be in India but when the product arrived, it mentions that it is made in China. I bought this product as I wanted to buy Made in India product but they are misleading people by mentioning manufacturer based India"
4,"It does not come with backlit keyboard as found in some of the answers. It is a decent laptop, but has some heating issues. I added a laptop fan beneath and the heating is not an issue anymore. Boot is pretty fast.This a VFM laptop from dell."
1,If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst product. Motherboard stopped working in a month. They replaced it and in just 10 days another issue started. It shows Bios error and laptop does not start.DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARN MONEY ON THIS MEDIOCRE PRODUCT.
4,The battery backup is not even 50% of what's mentioned in the description. charging time adapter overheating ...
1,The laptont seller and Amazon together are doing a fraudd taking money abd delivering sone junk crap abd using our money intrest free for weeks
5,I like the built quality it is best and after the 11 upgrade it will give a good competition to Mac book
1,Heating to much because of vents covered by led panel. Hest accumulated due to the vents covered by lid. Poor heat management. And poor and irresponsible service from dell. Laptop crashed two times.
1,"When type @, it shows different key. Not just one key but most of the keys are like that."
3,No doubt the laptop is good but the budget is too high. You can buy other brand like HP or Asus with many more features with 8 GB ram. While this gives u only 4 GB ram in 54k. Not worth pay. It doesn't even have backlit! If you a heavy software user I suggest you to go for other brand.
4,Not experienced much because it is too early to say anything within 1 month of buying a Laptop. Was expecting  laptop sound to be more but will wait more time when will be used extensively.
5,"After using for 2 weeks.. Completely dissatisfied with the product.. Refurbished laptops are better than this dell model.. Problem with trackpad. Audio settings, always hanging... etc.. etc.. Don't buy this product.. Worst model"
3,My laptop caps lock light is always on trying to reach the customer care not responding and issue is still not sort it out.I have no idea that wheather caps lock on are off every time wen i type a password its confusing me
1,u can surely get something better than thislemme rephrase something a lot better than this for the money u are going to pay!!
5,I like this product speakers are best the screen is very best nice in worth of money nice laoptop nice.
3,I just bought this laptop and it was lagging for 2 sec after every click so I updates the latest version of windows 10 few drivers and after restarting it a couple of times the lag is no more but it's still 1sec lag. Now that the windows 11 is out will it replaced even if update and still lags?
1,You need to get ready atleast 25 minutes before the class for children if you are going to use this laptop.
1,Worst product I have ever bought on Amazon. It was complete dead system and the return process was the most horrible one.
1,Tooo slow .....
2,Good product
1,"The process I slow,"
5,"Ryzen 5 5500U is the best chipset you can find in the mid-range laptops which even gives a run for the money to Core i7 processors that being said major cons I found were -Pros -1. Ryzen 5 5500U (no lag what so ever even with 8 GB ram)2. Upgradable RAM to additional 16GB in the one slot which is empty (8GB onboard is soldered to the mother board)3. Additional slot for 2.5 HDD/SDD4. 300 nits decent display5. WiFi 6 (works like a charm with my 100 mbps wifi) & Gigabit ethernet port6. Light weight (under 1.8kg for a 15.6inch laptop)7. Good laptop for techies - Linux Support (I have tested Garuda Linux *Arch based distro) works well for most parts, bluetooth and webcam have some issue which needs to be fixed but otherwise works smooth (these issues may not be there with Ubuntu/Debian, haven't tested it yet)8. Battery life is decent expect around 5-6 hours of backup with light usage.Edit: Bluetooth and Webcam issue fixed by using 5.10.40-1-lts kernel in arch/Garuda linuxCons -1. Built in speakers sound low for my likingHighly recommend this laptop for power users (techies/programmers). I haven't tested any games as of yet as I work mostly with Linux. Light gaming should be fine better than Intel onboard graphics for sure!."
4,"I was eyeing for this laptop since its announcement.Earlier I was using a i5 6th gen processor laptop which was slow comparing to this....The machine highlights after using it for a month, Very neat and simple design, No heating issue.1. The performance is great and snappy.2. The battery life is 4-6 hours at normal usage.3. Boot time is around <10 seconds.4. The build quality is normal but loved the Aluminum top cover.5. The look is quite simple and professional.6. The screen quality is FHD, great for the price.7. I loved the Backlit Keyboard8. WiFi connectivity is great with AX Technology.9. Sound - Good, use headphone is you are a music lover :-P10. Overall it's a great laptop for the price.RAM, HDD & SSD can be upgraded...4 Star only because of Poor Support from ACER..."
5,Best laptop
5,"I found this Laptop on ACER and Croma site at night for 53K and 52K. Being sleepy, I left it and next morning it was out of stock on both. Then I bought it on Amazon for 56K less 1K discount for HDFC card.I have my old laptop ACER Aspire V3-471G with Core-i7 3630QM processor. I used it for 9 years and it is still working.  This one is a bigger beast.Pros -1. Ryzen 5 5500U is better than most Core i7 CPUs.2. Upgradable RAM to additional 16GB in the one slot which is empty (8GB onboard is soldered to the mother board)3. Additional slot for 2.5 HDD/SDD4. Anti glare  full HD good display5. WiFi 6 works smoothly6. Light weight (under 1.8kg for a 15.6inch laptop)7. Good laptop for techies - Linux Support (I have installed Linux Mint XFCE.) Everything was detected and works well. There is only one issue, which I am not sure whether it's an issue- Display works at 77 hzs8. Battery life is decent expect around 5-6 hours of backup with light usage.9. I am using Windows 10 in Virtualbox under Linux Mint Host. That requires multiple CPU cores. My old Laptop would become hot upto 87'C with two OSs running in it. This one is a real beast. Temperature rarely crosses 50' C even in summer.10. A Hard disk caddy is supplied along with the laptop for installing second HDD or SSD. I went to nearby ACER support center for installing additional 1TB SSD and 8GB RAM. It took only 10 minutes at reasonable charges.Great value for money 55kCons -1. Built in speakers sound is  lower than average."
5,just you look this laptop every things has been provide most important is that acer service centre. Today I have visited with my laptop to install external HDD. what a service just took 5 minutes. Manager Jogesh has tolled me due pandemic I am ready to send my technical staff in my resident. What more you want. Another best quality service of Amazon they have give me this ACER ASPIRE AMD RYZEN 5-5500U laptop within 04 days. Amazon hats off You. Its looks too Good and best keyboard minor sound supposed to be high. Otherwise every parts & function are too excellent. ACER Wishing you all the best . I was purchased first  laptop on  2007 it was Acer next two are HP now again I purchased ACER.
5,"Everything's great in this machine.Boots within 10 sec. To the main home screen.It's fast and snappy..The only flaw is the screen bleeding. You can check in the attached image when dark wallpaper was applied and under full dark room. Picture was taken.Nothing serious. In normal use anyone won't notice just in case if you are in dark room there may be chances it may be visible.Talking about the ""sound quality"".It is quite loud in my case I didn't feel like loudness is less. It's good. Display colors are good but can be tweaked in Radeon app settings."
5,Good laptop overall
5,"Excellent battery life, decent screen with IPS so good viewing angles, Lightweight aluminium top body, boots up and shuts down in seconds because of 8GB RAM and 512 GB SSD. AMD Radeon Graphics does the job well, can play light games. Soft and brisk touchpad. Overall a good package in the price."
4,"Used it for a week and....Good battery life, lasts around 8 hrs with wifi on, bluetooth off, screen at 50 percent brightness n doing medium tasksAverage speakers n webcam, should have been better at this price pointAverage screen, it is ips but colours arent accurate enough, brightness is adequate and the antiglare type helps tooGood performance through the ryzen 5500u, that's the highlight hereNo heating issues as suchGood design n build quality even though half of it is plasticBacklit keyboard is good with decent key travel and it can be turned off during daytime to save some battery, typing on it feels nice for a laptopComes with an extra hdd mounting slot, pre installed windows and ms officeOverall 4/5, was in need of a laptop so bought it at 60k without waiting for discounts, but anywhere below 55k its a good deal for sure"
5,"We had purchased for our son and he just loved using the laptop for everyday use, Coding, watching videos, attending webinars and attending his classes online. The battery backup is amazing and the Laptop overall is just awesome. No issues as of now connecting to Wifi 2.5 ghz/ 5 ghz band. Since we have Airtel broadband the Wifi autoconnects to highest 5 ghz band and is super fast. Laptop opens up super fast and depends on if we have configured any login password or personalised photos/background during Laptop login page, based on which little difference may be seen but overall great processor for faster access to anything to be done with this laptop. Not has an opportunity to contact ACER for any issue as Laptop is working great. Thank You."
5,"Great laptop with very high quality screen,the battery life is around 7 hrs and the trackpad is just excellent"
4,Caps lock is not having a point beam ...when it is off ...other features are as expected
5,Good value for money. There‚Äôs only one s drawback - the speakers are not loud enough.
1,Speaker and cameraquality is so cheapNot recommended for online classes and kidsDifficulty in returning itCheap productNever do shop with amazon
4,Very sleek...light weight...very fast...
5,Had only 2 days after buying...Overall Battery life is good ...Backlit keyboardLite weight...Performance is good ..Win 10 n Ms office license version.
5,"Excellent battery life, can easily last upto 10hrs.Boots in 6-7sec.Build quality great for a plastic build.Has an overall professional look and feel"
5,Product as mentioned
1,It's a complete waste of money product. Sound Volume and Quality is worst. Build quality is very basic.
1,Can't return now. Bad product
5,Very slim lapy and the processor is awesome....... Just go for it
1,Not Good Product of Acer Aspire 5 AMD Ryzen 5 5500U Processor
5,"Great product,fully satisfied"
5,"Amazing display, good battery backup"
4,Good
5,"The 5500U is, to slightly put it, ABSOLUTELY BONKERS, Gives even the Current Generation i7s, (dare I say i9s) a run for their money. Compiles the entire Linux kernel in under a minute (If you don't know what that means, let me tell you its Performance is Beyond Comprehension)Cooling is quite awesome, albeit borrowed from ROG machines (That's a Good Sign too), it definitely shows ingenuity.The iGPU isn't as powerful as DGPUs but that's obvious, Not bad.RAM? 8 Gigs which is good enough for most people, but if you aren't one of them, You can expand upto 24 Gigs (IMO 16GB is Good Enough for me so I stuck with that) Basically, overkill for the target demographic and if you want even more, I think 60K isn't the price range you should be looking at.Gaming -Haven't tested much gaming on this though, just some Rainbow Six: Siege, Halo 3, Far Cry 3 and MW3 all running on KVM on Manjaro Linux (Tux reigns supreme), except for Siege, which I had to run using dual boot because of BattlEye's KVM Restrictions (Those Pricks). Performance for all of them is acceptable seeing that they are in fact running on iGPUs.Programming -As stated above it compiles the entire linux kernel in under a minute so compilation tasks won't suffer (Tested on gcc, ghc, elixirc, javac, nasm+ld and rustc). As for parsing goes, it shines there as well 4 Ghz is more than enough to run any interpreted application and 12 threads are enough to handle any async task (Tested on NodeJS, Python 3.9, leiningen, racket and haxe running in interpreted mode). Ran Multiple CLion, IntelliJ Idea and Webstorm Instances without it breaking a sweat, even with a Kjillion Daemons like PgSQL, Dgraph, MySQL, Docker (7 Containers!), and a local Kubernetes Cluster (3 Containers)An eloquent machine for anyone who can appreciate its elegance, Programmers, Techies, Gamers, all alike"
5,"Merits1. Battery life lasts once charged almost a day and half on economical use.2. Weight- Medium weight, does not feel like burden on shoulder or in hands.3. Processor- Powerful enough to work swiftly.4. RAM- Expansion limit to 24GB. Upgraded5. Silver Colour- Makes feel premium6. Integrity - Non flexible. Damage proof from certain height.Demerits1. MS Office- Not activated. (Should have been)2. Expandable memory- Slot should have atleast 1TB HDD3. Backlight Keyboard - Has no dimmer. Too much brightness in dark room.4. No fingerprint scanner.Conclusion - Perfect for the multiple works. Could have been feature-rich in this range but lacks.Advisable to buy."
4,"I am sharing this review after purchasing laptop from local shop where I get best deal.. here are some genuine reason why you with pros and cons..,Pros---1. Full Hd screen with ips display it's very looking great.2. AMD rzyn 5 -5500 Au beats processor.3. Camera quality decent but not above average as compare to other high priced laptop, works good.4. Backlit keyboard and very good Mouse pad work good in gesture also.5. Build quality was good as compared to HP and dell , having metal on top and premium plastic on keyboard.6. Less booting time less than 5 sec to start and same time to shut down, thanks for SSD and 8 GB ram.7. Looks professional and attractive.8. Battery back us is good after I used 4 hours on single charges still 45 % battery is remaining and charging time is 2 hours so it will also a good for heavy users.Cons -1. Speaker is very poor in terms of listening songs or watching movie it's should be great if having powerfull spkr or take a Bluetooth speaker for this things with add on.2. Don't have finger prints reader where in this price Acer should add FPS.I found only this cons rest overall laptop is quite premuim also give super speed not lag at all I can do a bit of video editing and gaming also but yes only speaker is very low interns of other laptop rest is very good laptop under 58k...If u are looking for beast laptop than go for it believe me u don't regret but onl thing is that take a Bluetooth speaker for enternating purpose of u user somewhere....thanks I hope this will help u.."
5,"Good laptop, 6 core 12 thread's cpu with 8gb soldered ram, can be expanded upto 24gb , slot for 2.5 inch hard disk / sata 2.5 inch ssd is given which can be installed upto 2tb, mounts are provided for that, 1080p ips screen and backlit full side keyboard provided though backlit keyboard brightness can't be controlled, available for a lesser price, check acer online store or offline store."
5,"i got this laptop 15 days ago .after usage of 15 days i csn conclude this is a beast laptop in terms of performance ,battery life ,display ,body n finish etc .its a complete package .i had tested GTA 5 on 720p settings .gta 5 gives a average fps of around 41-42 at stock ram .if i add more ram to this then only god knows this beast's performance ...video editing can also be done smoothly .battery backup is around 7-8 hours on normal usage ..."

4,"Hello,I'm writing this review after using this laptop for a month.I bought this product for my daughter's online school education. As such this laptop does pretty well on that front. No doubt that Avita has cut lot of corners to provide a product in this budget which should be expected, afterall laptops with decent performance are not cheap. Buy this if you only intend to surf internet, online learning, emails and work on MS Word or such document softwares. As the processor is very basic don't have much expectation for gaming or any other processing heavy programs.Positives:1. Screen is gorgeous with minimal bazels.2. Weighs really light. A kid can easily handle it which translates into less chances of damage.3. Good on-site service. I placed a request, the technician visited next day and was able to address my concerns.4. Sufficient battery life.5. Looks cool and different.6. Good enough camera.7. SSD provides smooth performance. There is no lag whatsoever. Laptop boots up within some seconds. Got 192 Gb usable space out of 237 gb. Connect external hdds or usb drives if more space needed.Negatives:1. Wifi range is poor.2. All the ports are at the back which makes them hard to reach.3. Positioning of the camera is on the keyboard surface which gives no flexibility to manage its angle. However, apart from an awkward position, there is no hindrance in capturing the subject using the laptop.4. Power chord length is quite short.5. Track pad isn't very smooth but manageable. I had to bump up its settings in Windows. Using an external mouse will provide better experience.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
1,Very bad
4,"The product is good but it has some problems , first If your thinking that you can do gaming in this laptop , then it will not work , DON'T BUY THIS LAPTOP FOR GAMING, you can use it for office work and normal students type work , 2nd amd most worst part is you are not going to get its accesories , because AVITA is not known in India."
4,"After reading  so many different feedback on different products I made my self to order this laptop which is not so old and trusted brand let me tell you ,  but the most attractive things of this laptop is it is providing same features which is there in other brand at high price , but this  the only brand in the market which comes below 25k , thats why people get attract , but using this laptop for only one day, it is not even twitching on , seems like dead automatically I have request to call centre and asked them to replace,amd I trust amazon it is known for its service over the world so no meed to worry about ... Thank you"
3,"Comes with genuine windows 10, and also office installed but not activated.Camera quality is ok, but position is weird. You can't adjust angle.All ports are in backside, may be difficult to access them.Screen Quality is good.No cooling fan, system will heatup easily after a 30 mins use.Touchpad experience is not good. Though it is working, it is not comfortable.Screen to body ratio is highGood looking with good design.Amazon delivery is very good and package packing is also good."
5,"Fully satisfied with laptop. Bought it for online classes, net surfing and for my documents it does absolutely great work in all those areas.Surely not for gaming purpose. SSD drive makes it really fast in booting. Although it's processor is not so powerful therefore lag is visible when you go for heavy multitasking; CPU meter easily reaches 100.There is no fan in the bottom at times it even terrifies that overheating may not harm it internally. Screen is gorgeous therefore no issue with movie watching."
5,Boot in 22 secondsWord Excel and PPT works without any hasslesCamera angle is fine. If we keep it in the table it's very goodLight weightTeams and Telegram works fineOnline video plays fineOverall a value for money package
4,"Theek hai low budget k hisab se, lekin budget increase karsakte ho to koi aur hi Lena. Plus warranty registration me problem aarahi hai"
1,Product delivered on time but keyboard stopped working after 15 days. Didn't get it repaired even in one month. No return after 10 days so I have to face the harassment. After a month even customer service don't respond..Don't buy..
5,"Its value for money. Good for basic use like attending meetings, word, excel, power point presentation. Surfing, you tube etc ..With SSD, no speed issue."
1,Kept spinning for 3 hours but the setup didn't completed. Wasted a lot of time talking to agents finally I lost around 2k bucks and purchased another hp laptop
5,Because they compare to the processer is very first.best deel 2 yr  warranty provided  Avila that will for some small  small  software use propouse to  purchase nothing else... Lile:meeting attend  online classes like  editer small  small to use...
4,"I like it's performance but it has a little heating issue and bettery is not long lasting. It's useful for study and office work perpose,not for gaming and editing.I mostly like it's display,it's display so attractive and nice."
1,"Yeah, it's cheaper but worse as it has 2yrs warranty but it's battery is not working now where I buy it just 1 month before."
4,"Best budget laptop. Rest all are fine for 20k only disadvantage is camera. It housed on keyboard, ok for students but for a teacher u need to have an external webcam."
1,"The product was defective , the laptop battery was not charging and then Amazon refused to replace it. Had the worst experience. Would rate it -10 if I could."
5,"Short space Ssd,others are nice,Smoothly  work"
4,"Great screen, good if you don't need heavy processing power. Build is a bit flimsy though. But at the price, real value for money."
1,Battery life is very very poor
5,Excellent and cheap

5,I liked the SSD hdd and speedy booting.
5,This laptop is perfect for student or for home
1,Battery not good
5,Best
3,Daily on line work
5,GUD
3,Product has a rich texture...but lacks in durability and performance...download sucks...takes hours to download...the camera is so awkwardly placed....u can do minimal stuff like...surfing....classes...or lectures...I would certainly not recommend this product to kids for online classes due to the placement of the camera....sound quality is good....
5,"Nice performance ,best battery ,worth buying ,cheap in price , , , , , , , , , , ,"
1,This is a bad product don't go for it wasteof money waste of time don't buy it please üôè .
4,Very nice laptop for students and work from home. I think you should go buy this lappy if you are student and employee in any company
4,"After using it for 2 months, this is what I can say-The display is quite good, although not top-notch, it has good contrast however the brightness could be better. The screen does not glare but you will have discerning what's on the screen if you're using it right under the sun on a bright day.The battery gives around 4-6 hours. Acceptable.The performance is spectacular. I'm not editing or gaming but, for your everyday office work or your assignments, you will have no trouble whatsoever.The hardware is solid and looks premium. The keyboard doesn't have much travel but the backlight has three levels which I found out just yesterday.Major drawback- the computer heats up. Especially, when you're using it while charging (not too hot like it can cook eggs, but it can definitely melt butter). But that won't bother won't bother you a lot if you are in a cold place, then you can use as a hand warmer except, for your lap.The speakers were unprecedented. I was not expecting anything in the audio quality, but boy..... If you keep it on a table the sound it gives is amazing.The fingerprint sensor is quite responsive for a laptop.All in all this device is impressive. If I had the same budget, I'd buy it again. But if you don't mind spending  a couple of bucks more and for all you peeps with deep pockets, don't waste your time and buy the M1 Macbook"
5,"Model: Intel i5-11300H processor, 16 GB RAMI bought this laptop for coding and app development so I went with the more powerful H series processor. The laptop is very easily able to run all the programming tasks including VSCode, Android studio along with running an android virtual device.To get the most performance out of the machine, toggle the power option to best performance mode and plugin the AC adapter otherwise the battery will drain fast. For regular usage such as browsing and watching videos, it can be operated on battery (unplugged) with the ""better battery"" power mode for about 6-7 hours easily.The display is very crisp and clear with good color accuracy. The official display details for this laptop are a bit unclear in the dell specifications document. Overall it is a very good display with thin bezels.It has excellent speakers (for a laptop) with loud enough sound for watching movies without headphones.The fingerprint reader is not the best when compared to smartphones.This machine is not for Gaming as it has lower refresh rate and very slow screen response time. Although it should be able to run games at low settings.Overall it is a good and handy device which works well when used with the proper settings in the right way."
1,"While setting up the laptop, screen went wonky...total colour distortion and hung up. Have asked replacement....don't know if it's worth buying"
1,"In specification, mentioned  4 1 Ghz processes but I received 3.0 GHz processor. It is a cheating. Seller take money for high configuration and provide low configuration üò•"
1,"Speaker is buzzing, new laptop, out of the boxEdit: The replacement laptop speaker is the same. You won't hear the buzzing while listening to a song or video however while increasing or decreasing system volume, the chimes crack, also for Windows pop ups, the chime sound cracks at more than 50% volume. Really weird issue."
5,It's a awsm laptop with premium looks and great performance.
2,"It was good just for 7 days post delivery. I am not sure if i made a mistake buying it online. Laptop stopped working on 8th day and i had no option to place a request for replacement. I called customer service of HP they said within 48 hrs technician should visit and it's been more than 48 hrs and i have not even received any call. I spent Rs 42k and as i have to do work from home, my work is hampering also. Cpu turns on but no display. Did all troubleshooting but no improvement for this NEW GEN HP LAPTOP.On 27th HP sent an engineer and they are ready to help howver my case is pending  as of 16th April, as Amazon did not mention the serial num on invoice and p-slip. HP needs invoice with Serial number. I am very much disappointed as i am stuck between two big brands...it is good if machine works fine if you are unlucky then may gonna pissed off after sale. Let's see how long do i have to wait to obtain the correct invoice from HP.Note- accept invoice with sr number mentioned on it then only HP can entertain easily."
1,"Hi,I am totally disappointed with this purchase. I have spend the heavy amount but still i couldn't use the product. My request for replacement also not happened due to some irrelevant reason. I bought this laptop for son's study purpose. Due to this bad sales service my son's study also got impacted. Now this defective item is with me last 10 days. If my problem is not resolved in another two days. I will take this issue in next very seriously.Request your immediation action to resolve the issue.Thanks and Regards,Kajamydeen T"
1,"Horrible experience! First there was flinch in the screen ao i had to talk to the customer service for 2 hours before they declared it fit to be replaced. After I got a replaced laptop within 5 days the speakers went off, they started producing the most obnoxious voices. But till i realised i had to return it again it the 8th day and amazon couldn't replace. So I contacted hp they helped me but everyday i had to sit for hours talking to them explaining them their person came home checked it labelled it suitable to be replaced boxed it seqled it saying amazon will pick up. But nothing! Nor from Amazons side nor from hp its been 1 month now my laptop is sealed and kept. I'm calling everyday mailing everyday but no response. Its like my 50,000‚Çπ have gone down the drain! Horrible services from both sides!"
1,I bought HP15s fr 2006tu it was delivered on 27/03/2021.When I was doing simple work but its laptop charger and laptop also getting heating problem so kindly see that and resolve the issue
1,"The laptop worked OK for 1 day. The other day itself after starting laptop, screen was frozen. Screen got completely wanky, broken and still. Running laptop hangs up & shuts down automatically. This was happening frequently. Just see the pics.I requested for return but the process of return itself was such a cumbersome process. Wasn't guided properly by customer care also. I ordered laptop in such an urgent situation that I needed laptop within 2 days. But it took me 2 long weeks for returning the laptop that too after continuous follow up, requests, arguments etc. Worst experience. Trust broken. I very DISAPPOINTED & SAD with the DEFECTIVE LAPTOP received from AMAZON."
5,Pros1.Display2.Very fast operation3.battery life4.light weight5 Msoffice 2019 student life timeConsBody is plastic looks delicateKeypad looks cheapNo backlight in keypad
1,Print on the keyboard keys is thin(font size and color) . Keyboard body color is silver. This makes it problematic to read keyboard keys. Especially at night when it shines due to room lights. This is bad design. It should be either in contrast color(black keyboard with white font) or it should come with back-lit keyboard. I even did not like display quality.
4,If looking for performance this laptop has best config and price comb. Boot in 5-6 sec. No lag. You get windows and office. Packing was good. All seal were intact.It can easily compete with i 5 9gen.But butbut there are some issuesFirst. The plastic quality is not that good. When you type the whole keypad goes down as the plastic there is thin.Battery backup is only 3-3.5hours with averahe load.The mcafee subscription was over when i got the laptop which is weird. But windows defender overcomes the need of any third party anti virus.Overall for performance its the best bang for your buck. Go for it. Just buy a wireless mouse for better effciencyScreen is also good but could have been brighter
3,"Bought it for 41999, so far haven't faced any issue.Not so good things to consider before you purchase it:1. build quality: very fragile, won't survive a drop.2. speaker: average.3. camera: below average.4. Missing RJ45 port.I will update my review if I face any issue."
4,"I am writing this review after using this laptop for more than a week. I will keep it short and to the point:Good things:1. I just loved its design and it is beautiful. Soothing silver color and very sleek. it just feels nice to touch the smooth surface.2. It is significantly lighter weight.3. Sound is good in this price range, I am satisfied.4. Speed is awesome. Core I3, 11th gen, and the SSD both make it awesome to work.5. Display, it is a bit warm display but very clear. Soothing to eyes. Night mode is also good.6. Bluetooth connectivity is also great. My earlier HP laptop used to drop the connection in between but this works seamlessly.7. it is very thin, I liked it.Things need improvement/ I did not like much:1. It gets heat up in just 30 mins of usage.2. It has only 2 USB ports that too together with charging port. This makes difficult to connect 2 USB and charger at the same time due to size of pen drive or devices port like mouse or external HDD.3. The cooling fan is at the bottom not at the sides which may be causing heat up issues because when you use it on the bed as many times we do, it does not work efficiently.4. Memory of SSD is only 512 GB which gets reduced by almost 100 GB due to OS and all. Of course, this is what is mentioned in the technical specification but this is something which bothers me slightly. They could have given 1 HDD of 1 TB and SSD combination which Dell and other laptops are providing. But this is not that bad. It is fine if you don't store much on the drive and use the cloud.5. Charger pin which we connect with a laptop is not very smooth. It has a lot to improve. I cannot connect smoothly as my earlier Lenovo, Dell, and HP laptops.6. It does not have a CD drive which is something missing. People who have old CDs/DVDs of marriages and functions might miss this, I do :(Conclusion: By and large, this is a perfect laptop for normal usages like studies and work. Not suitable for gaming though. Its lightweight, slim design and soothing silver color appearance backed with 11th gen core i3 processor with SSD makes it perfect and fast to use. I recommend this to users who wanna use it for work and study purposes. I wish the USB port should have been more scattered instead of consolidated near the charging port. Overall, awesome product, I am happy with this."
4,"I made this review after using this laptop for 3 months as a good laptop to buy under 42K.I used it for last two months and I only faced the problem regarding battery life.  Battery consumed very quickly and also there was a issue of  heating. Although heating problem was normal in laptops. Otherwise it was vey fast, response quickly and no lag.  The camera was not so good. It was weighing light and thin and also it has a gloomy metal like finish which makes it's look quite awesome. Overall it was good for normal uses . I got this product without any  fault and as it was depicted in the display."
4,"I am working with i5 & i7 laptops and this is my first laptop i3 haven't notice big difference because of SSD and 11th generation version without hard drive. Setup took very less time , very fast processing. Sound quality good and Picture quality satisfactory. Within this cost I must say it's fabulous, must buy and enjoy working. I will not suggest for gaming purpose. Silver colour body makes executive looks, slim and very handy. Light weight and elegant design. I must give five star but somewhere I don't know I am rating four star.....may be something missing like sound card. Overall it's good laptop. Let's see in coming days how it performs and battery life....good luck."
1,This laptop closed many times. Screen always gets crashed if we are watching any video Or doing any work . And exchange date has also crossed. I m not satisfied with the laptop. Only 10 Or 12 days has crossed.. And arising lots of problem
1,Purchased this Laptop last week and not happy with performance.Cons1. Booting issue. It takes long time to open in spite of latest BIOS version updated2. Takes long time to load any apps/browser. Very slow3. Battery backup is very poor. Hardly lasts for 1.5 hours after 100% charge4. This laptop is made out of China and comes with hardly very cheap manual of just 2 or pages sheet. Doesn't look Dell quality. I didn't expect that such cheap product from Dell
2,"Ordered this product from amazon as dell categories this model under business and delivery time is 1 month. So went with high end config of I5, 11th Gen, 8GB mem and 1TB HDD but it was very shocking package received was damaged and box was already opened or used. The performance of the product is very poor and it take long time to show-up the login screen and any application performance is very bad. Also extending the dell warranty is nightmare as there is no response from Dell for this product finally the quote was quite higher than the original purchase E.g if you order thru dell extending additional 2 year of warranty is around 1999 but if you do it separate it cost around 5000 . So purchased additional 500GB of WD NVME and made the system boost ending up spending 55k for this product without extended warranty which is quite expensive for this model"
5,"I received a faulty laptop first, then I spoke with Amazon executive and they helped me to get an another one as replacement ""Thanks Amazon"". It's been less than a week since i have been using this laptop, so far i don't see any issues and works fine as described & expected. The battery backup is very good and look wise also it's good."
1,"The laptop provides a good specification but they are really cheap and inefficient. To consider an example the Core i5 11th generation performs poorly than a Core i5 8th generation. The HDD also performs really bad especially while booting. The booting time varies between 2 mins to 5 mins. That's too long considering the pace of technology and the price of the product, almost 50k. It's sad that Dell is producing cheaper thousands of cheaper, worthless variants in the market rather than used to have a couple of awesome variants in past. So, be careful while buying, and DO NOT BUY THIS ONE.** Also Amazon.in has a bad return policy and they won't take it back."
4,"My daughter has been using it from last few week for her online classes.The laptop have only 1 drive which is HDD so boot time is little longer.Otherwise every thing is working fine.The build quality is good,trackpad function is smooth.The body has a mat finish and give an elegant look.14 inch screen,11th generation intern core i5.This was the cheapest model with above configuration ."
1,This product makes too much noise if the fan which is strange as well as there is no easy replacement policy of this product.When I asked to replace it within 7days they asked me to schedule technician visits instead of replacement or return .
1,"Very slow to boot up and also slow while loading applications, frequent firmware updates(every two days) and have done at least 3 times since I bought it in a space of one week. The laptop shows a blank dark screen after reboot and then i need to shut down and restart again multiple times. Frustrated after a week's use and returning the product."
1,Not worth money. The laptop didn‚Äôt boot up after 4 long hrs of installation. The product will only be replaced & no returns accepted and every time after replacement the customer should pay installation charges which costs around 800 bucks. Ideal to buy expensive items at authorised stores.
5,Good features quite fast battery backup is also sufficient and enough. Can be a better option for anyone below 50k
1,Laptop speed is slow ... It's getting stuck ..taking more times for open and speed is not good ... Pls üôè don't purchase this laptop ..bad experience this lappi
2,The system speed is extremely slow. I made a complaint on 25th Feb. I was told that system will be replaced within 48 hours. It is already more than one week but my system has not been replaced.
1,Poor quality and never advised for this product. With the same cost lots of peer companies give good quality product.
1,"Dont buy it, waste Rs50000 .Key board is hard and i think they have give used laptop for me. This model is not at all good. See product they have not shared clear front images purposely."
1,This doesn't seems to be i5 . Very very slow ...without any application it's slow like this what will happen when I will install other applications and software
1,I totally dislike the product ....It is worked properly about one week.....And then it is totally started misbehaving like very slow and Not responding any Apps....So don't buy this laptop

1,"Worse Laptop I have ever seen, not worthy product even system was not fast even it's don't have any data. Don't put investment on this laptop."
1,"I bought this notebookThe configuration is completely inconsistent with the information published by the shop.The computer received is an i3 system, and the memory does not have 1T"
4,The laptop is being used to attend online classes for the past one and a half months. It mysteriously shuts down in the middle of a test or an assignment and has to be restarted.
1,"Guys, please don't buy this..i3 processor is far better than this.  @Dell please recall this product back ASAP"
4,"It is good laptop, but a little costly than earlier purchased of same configuration."
1,"Horrible, Nightmare, after receiving the screen went off, OS problematic, Mother Board defective. The  company policy says no replacement of laptop. Stay away or buy if you really want to drain some hard earned money."
4,The system is good and m√©ets the requirements.
4,"I like it's build quality, display,camera , but because of 1tb HDD speed is little bit slow but acceptable. Good for gaming intact higher gaming but the hot winds coming out position can be improved."
1,I bought a laptop which is i5 8gb ram it is not working for multy tasking they won't take return before buying they mentioned return and replacement after they said policy of replacement only if it is damage only
1,Very slow processing please don't buy it.

5,All good
5,Good.. So far.
1,Horrible service from Amazon ....Don't waste your hard earned money to buy this product doesn't work well...very very slow
5,Worst laptop not working properly since start
5,Laptop is compact.  Right  size. Worth the money
2,Laptop is very slow.
2,It‚Äôs creating problem every now and then. I will  not buy laptops from Amazon in future.
5,"Bought Ryzen 5 version of this from a HP store near Thoraipakkam in Chennai  two months back (Ryzen 7 wasn't available anywhere then).Solid performer, Great screen 400+nits 16:10, incredibly silent, good thermals.Slight drawback is avg keyboard & mediocre palm rejection on trackpad. KBD has slight wobble and different pressure on lower left (Ctrl & Shift) keys."
5,"It's really fast and it is the lightest laptop in the market, enjoying it a lot. AMD Ryzen 7 5800u processor is blazing fast. It is Cheaper to buy from Hp store."
4,First of all it's not lenovo laptop slim 3i but it's lenovo laptop slim 3 so it's a mistake. Otherwise product is good. It's been a couple of weeks I received this laptop and enjoying it. 512 gb ssd puts extra power on performance and 8gb RAM is also supportive for performance and faster response.One should buy it for performance. Here are some goods about this product:Pros:1. Lid can be opened up to 180 degree.2. Fingerprint lock.3. Privacy shutter on webcam.4. Good build quality.5. Performance is good.Cons:1. Backlit keyboard is not there.2. Dvd/cd reader is not there.3. No VGA/HDMI port.
4,"Everything is good except the battery life. If you are working with the videos, the battery drains very quickly and the life reduces to hardly 2- 2.5 hours."
3,"Over all product seem to be goodüëçBody of laptop is sturdy . but it comes without back lit keyboard, and one month trail antivirus , battery back up is 2:00 to 2:30 hrs only."
1,"Ordered this laptop in Freedom sale . Delivered in 2 days . When tried switching on, it is not starting ,but charging is working just fine. Ordered a replacement and they again delivered a faulty laptop with the same issue. The guy who came for returning is now saying that since it's not working we can't accept the return . Totally disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è"
4,"Amazon mentioned the laptop has pre-installed MS Office Home and Student 2019.But no such MS Office is there.When I start my laptop, it is asking me to buy Microsoft 365 personal.Plz help..."
5,Awesome.. extremely good for home usuages.
4,"I have been using this Product for 2 weeks. The Pros & Cons are following:Pros: 1. System speed is very fast, as 7.75 gb is usable RAM.2. Slim fit & good outlook as well.Cons:1. Battery drains too fast, battery power not really good.2. Adapter size is too short, this creates problem while charging from a socket which is little bit away.Apart from the upper points, also check the warranty window after buying it, as for my case, I have to mail to Lenovo for updating my Warranty details (It was not updated properly)."
5,"It's an awesome product. Very much helpful for work from home. It doesn't heat at all. It has features like Mac Book. Slim product, looks good. System doesn't hang at all. I am writing this review after one month of using."
4,"Found this laptop to be v sleek, overall.Like the keyboard (find the keys to be softer than most other laptop keyboards; more 'pleasant'? for typing, relatively speaking, though not quite as pleasant as it is w a MacBookPro).Like the way the touchpad has been positioned slightly to the left.Also like the fingerprint sensor doubling up as the power on/off button.Front-facing cam quality also relatively good, along with wide coverage of (user) background.Would have preferred more RAM along with the whole pkg.Would have preferred more SSD storage space for this budget.Budget-wise, feel this is priced up by about 20%, and I think that it will sell more units if Lenovo brings it down accordingly.Overall, defn a good buy, and I'd recommend it for anyone who wants this config of laptop for their business/home purposes."
1,Dislike  it has technical problem . Laptop is shutting down continuously.
5,"Packaging was very neat and solid. The product itself is very good. Good speed and easy installation. The McAfee 1yr offer for virus protection was very cheap. So I went for it. All features are good. Since it is a slim model, you might feel a little wobbling of the screen part when you move around with he laptop in hand. Otherwise a very good product."
5,How to install microsoft Office 2019
5,It's a good laptop for daily usage...very fast and nice to handle...but battery draining fastly...I was played some games also.. good response.... overall it's a good laptop for this price..
2,Working fine  but the price must b below Rupees 45000.00and i just getting heating issue from last month
5,Bought for programming and personal use.Great performance. Great quality laptop.
4,MS office is not included. It's asking to purchase while doing the initial setup. This is different from the product description...
5,Great Product! - Sleek and Slim
4,Its superb 512gb ssd gives a great speed experience.Finger print lock works well and it takes only 5 to 10 seconds to boot.Only disadvantage is battery is quite low it gives power back up of 3 hrs overall its nice product must buy this product
4,"This is a slim model. because of that, compare to other model, Speaker sound is less. Battery running hour is average only. little bit difficult while typing. due to keyboard. Other than that remaining is ok"
3,I liked it's swiftness. How easily it logs in and how fast it works.I don't like It's battery capacity. The battery is very bad and discharges very quickly. It feels like drain of battery.
4,There is nothing to add.
5,Satisfied purchase
4,Value for money.
4,It's quite lite weight and slim. If it was loaded with touch then it would have been provided  more value for money.Overall a good sleek product.
5,Excellent ...
4,It overall fine but there is some problem with this like after undergoing use of 3 days it shows some lagging issues that can be neglect. But overall it is fine
2,Worked fine till the day the Hard disk crashed. I think Lenovo quality has gone down
5,The laptop work properly and I am using it since 1 month it's processing time is best and fingerprint reader is very fast
1,Very slow
4,Very good laptop and budget friendly
5,It's perfect for fast processing and gaming
4,"I was looking for a sleek, big screen , n speedy laptop."
5,Features are good. Color options are available.
3,Yes we can buy it
4,Value for money
4,"I purchased this PC for my daughter school use..  It has a nvme drive (which is ligtniging fast) and 8 GB ram.Performance is decent. It comes with some bloat ware like lenovo tools, mcaffee anti-virus etc.. I promptly removed the mcafee antivirus (which is only a trial version), and the perfomeance improved quite a bit.I wish the display has 16:10 ratio, so it would have been much better for web browsing, online classes etc, but looks like only macbook has this display ratio.I am now dual booting with Linux Elemenatary OS, and it is remarkably much quicker to boot, much faster than windows.I am okay with the machine, I would have preffered to save on the unnecessary cost of Windows, as I am not usiing it.There are also a few brands like HP selling at this price point, I picked this one though due to the lighted keypad and fingerprint scanner.Camera and speakers are okay.. Just laptop quality.. External webcams will be better."
5,"One of the best laptop in this category. Did lot of research on HP, dell n Lenovo. But this one is the best. Using this since a month. Sleek, light wgt, premium look, finger lock. Highly recommended."
3,"Good performance ... no issues. However the body does not Talk about quality, extremely lightweight and feels cheap plastic.  Not sure about durability ... finally, u get what u pay for."
1,I brought this laptop on 14 Aug. After 7 days the display is not working. Don't buy this laptop.
4,Been over a month now. It looks awesome and is very fast! The only bummer that the speakers are not upto the mark as the volume is too low if you're in a noisy place but I guess it's okay! Battery backup lasts upto 6 hours but it can last longer if on a saver mode or if you dim the brightness. Windows 11 upgrade is free and is available now. You should definitely go for it. (I'll update this review if I counter any problem with it).
1,Had a horrible experience with quality. The laptop went dead within few days of arrival and Lenovo service response was pathetic. Will never touch a Lenovo product ever again.
5,"I bought it couple of days back, no complains and speed is also pretty good for personal use."
4,Only issue is with the WAN port which is a c type.
3,Please try HP
5,Very good product booting time very fast only 8sec
5,Good
3,this is shipped with Win10 and Office2019 and 1yr warranty. go for https://www.amazon.in/dp/B09JBYYHCS/ which is shipped with the latest Win11 and the latest Office2021 but is shipped with the same 1yr warranty.
4,"So overall for this price laptop is good... Just look out some things ,as you can see in image there is gap in the touchpad and it is wobbly I mean we're spending 45k and they're give touchpad like a cheap laptop, well I've got use to it but still, well it is working perfectly fine and accurate tracking but its not attached to surface so left and right click is bit wobbly... Also about battery its good if you use it in medium brightness... It's do its work.... Display is perfect with no reflection..... And its buttery smooth, its so fast that within a second the tab opens .... Also go for 512gb one because even you're using just internet it consumes a lot of storage due to updates and stuff..."
5,"Camera quality is nice. Anti glare üëå. I enjoy using this laptop . Have keyboard light night mode. Press Fn +windows start button + spacebar üëâTo on & off.  . Sometime in Bing search letters not appear while typing there so have to go to the url section (address bar) & type there for searching. But this is only small error. Stylish , easy carry. Reveiwed after 4 months of usage.thanks for seller & Amazonüôè"
5,"This pc is really good, it has a really good display and the Lenovo aware is really good you should just go for it."
4,"price was lower than near by showroom shop , features are good and plastic quality is according to costcamera is ok"
5,"with 8GB RAM and 256Gb SSD it is a powerful machine, opening the lid starts the laptop within 2 seconds and multitasking is very efficient. just auto upgraded to Win 11 and am enjoying using the laptop."
3,"For now, 3 stars. Lightweight laptop. Fast enough. Clear display. Good buy though considering I got discounted price & HDFC Imperia card points during recent sale.Pros:Fast.Clear display.Setup was easy and quick including McAfee Antivirus & Dropbox.Effortless for daily use for online classes (video streaming / zoom calls) for kids.Cons:Heating issue was seen. After using for about a few days, it doesnt heat up as much. Waiting till the day of return to see if I need to return it.Loads of WiFi issues on day one. Then found out that there were so many virtual adapters created for the WiFi adapter. Puzzling since this is supposed to be a brand new laptop and how would there be so many virtual adapters created? Once I disabled them all, WiFi worked fine.Battery time varies depending on when you login and you dont get accurate stats. Probably early days and it will take time to get tuned.The laptop has a very plasticky feel to it. Doesnt look sturdy at all.Overlooked the LAN Port thing. Please note that this laptop does not have a LAN Port.Laptop sticker says Inspiron 3000 whereas model number is 3511.Verdict:Bought a Lenovo E15 in Dec 2020 at a similar price point. Dell Inspiron 3511 comes up a notch below that one considering heating issues early on, wifi issues and the sturdy feel of the laptop."
3,All ok but heating problem is there and it's not 4.2 GHz it's only 2.4 GHz amazon doing  people fools wifi is dis connecting after minute to minute
4,"The laptop configuration was good. It's been 2 days of usage primarily for browsing, light gaming and media streaming. I know this might not be the best in the range when it comes to value for money, but DELL is DELL. Anyway if you want something more powerful give this dell laptop a try amazon.in/gp/product/B08GY2DR2ZPros:1. Performance is good - super fast boot up and shut down, and lag free browsing.2. No bloatwares in the laptop3. Superb battery life. I get close to 7 hrs if not more4. No heating as of now (haven't stretched it enough)5. Wifi reception is fine (not very good, but not bad either)6. Light weightCons:1. Viewing angles are decent, but not the best2. Speakers sound tinny (I've been spoilt with my office Mac book pro, so... )3. Webcam clarity is just about ok. Enough for online classTried FIFA, COD , FAR CRY and it works flawlesslyHaven't stretched it enough to pass a verdict.So far it's been quite impressive. Shall update if I happen to come across anything significant.I feel it's a good buy.I hope it helps."
1,"I bought this laptop on 2nd October on Amazon and got it delivered on the 11th. Within a week the touchpad of the product started hanging up, and in two weeks, it stopped responding completely (23rd October). (mind you for a week this laptop was anyway not being put to use because I was setting it up for use)I complained and got a technician to replace it and during replacement itself I told the technician that the hinges seem lose since his service and unless he fixes it, I will not sign the customer copy. He assured me that they were fine and any other replacements or repairs would require a new request through the central team. After arguing for a good 20 minutes he made me sign the receipt and left. Immediately after, the laptop started heating up within 10 minutes of good usage and in another week the laptop screen started peeling off from where the right screen hinge joins the keyboard.In-spite of complaining to the customer care of such a horrible product they refused to replace it saying I have already crossed the 1 month mark (24th November) beyond which replacement is not possible. So I went ahead reluctantly with a repair request only to be informed again after 10 days that the parts are not available until January 2022 so they'll provide a ""same-age"" laptop as replacement but even that'll take at-least 45 days. Now, while I'm waiting for another 45 days for laptop repair or replacement the left half of the screen is also starting to peel off and I have to hold the screen with both hands to keep it even open.Even a INR 2 popsicle is sold with a better shelf life than this ridiculous 60K worth laptop. Would never ever again make the mistake of going for Dell again."
1,Bought this laptop on October 2 2021 and on October 17 2021 its lid was stuck and didn't open. From Dell communities forum found that this is a very common issue. And now Dell support is claiming that invoice provided by amazon doesn't have service tag number and hence not valid. Now I am running from pillar to post to get this issue sorted.  Pathetic service from both Amazon and Dell.
1,The laptop works properly first few days. The camera brightness flickers. The speaker is not working properly. The laptop suddenly stopped and I had to reformat it. All this and it's been less than a month
3,"Its ok but battery  performance is not good, also heat up more"
5,Overall Good
5,Good One.
5,My father got a nice high-end laptop same model and configuration. 8 hr battery üîã life in 57500 rupees and this is in amazon.in overpriced. Best performance üëè.  Buy from physical store. Good for gamerz. Asphalt 9 legends works without any lag. Ram can be upgraded to 32gb and ms office 2019 preloaded. I received a windows 11 update. Good for online class and video making or editing
5,"Absolutely amazing screen.The sound quality is so good, it has a little bass too.Battery life is upto 5 hours, for better battery buy laptop with integrated graphics.Go for it if you know what you are doing."
5,best laptop withh low price and speed is nice and this battery backup is nice and the laptop backup is nice also.
1,The keypad is getting overheated in just a few miniutes. It is not possible to work using this laptop. Dell is unable to fix the problem.
1,Laptop is made of Plastic material got broken within a one month of usage not able to open laptop now
4,It's not 4.10  GBN it's only 2.10 GBN  and getting to much heating if want buy laptop plz research and buy
3,The processor speed mentioned in amazon listing shows is 4.2 GHz whereas actual speed received is 2.4 GhxThat is why I have not given 5 stars. Pls someone explain me how this happened.
3,"I bought this laptop during the sale just before Indepedence day sale. I have basic perspectives. My old Asus I3 was over 4 years old and was becoming slow. Coming from IT background, I wanted to purchase a laptop with good RAM, that will help me in my academics and I wanted the laptop to be moderately lighweight having provision for basic gaming. After extensive research through Amazon, finally I narrowed down to this laptop becuase it also had dedicated MX450 graphics on top of Intel Iris Xe dedicated graphics.The laptop worked well as long as basic browsing happened. the moment i started playing the videos, it will heat up, and most importantly, when I started doing light gaming, the laptop will become a baked oven, the fan will stop and boom, it will die. I tried changing settings, modifying power management in Settings, nothing would work.Now by light gaming, I mean ""Tell Me Why"" (2019 game). I do a lot of gaming in my PS4, so I can say with conviction that decision making games like these won't make much use of hardware graphics. I tried Alan Wake from 2011, the result was the same :( Both games were tried through Steam, not pirated ones.Alos, the battery would die in 2.5 - 3 hours on normal use.I called Amazon customer care and this is where they had been trully brilliant. I was initially told that the replacement policy is over by few hours, but they evetually understood my problem and scheduled a technician visit post which, they promised to replace the laptop, through the extended window. the technican delayed the process, again I called up Amazon, this time they went above and beyond and they staright away issued the replacement. Thanks a bunch to Amazon.Once the replacement came, I could see that the power chord was a different one, hence battery management was better. But the laptop heat issue won't go away., while playing games. Hence I had to bring in a laptop cooler to suffice it.Hence, long story cut short - HP has build a product to capture the market well, becuase if you compare with other brands, you won't get a configuration like this, that too with 1.41kg, reminding you that this is not a gaming laptop. But, while doing so, this product has undergone poor testing resulting in not so great quality.Pros:1. Great Display. I like watching movies through VLC, or Netflix /Prime, downlaoded through WQindows App Store.2. Might Sound cliche, but the WIndows 10 is super fast.3. The boot time is between 8-10 secs.4. Comes with Office 2019, just need to activate it.5. I have tried few academics related software and basic video editing, it really works well.6. 16GB RAM is a blessing.7. 2 GB RAM does support basic gaming, at least doing well for my replaced laptop.Cons:1. While playing game, get yourself prepared to face lot of pain. I had repalced my laptop once, and now bought a cooler to suppress the heat while playing. On ""HWMonitor"" software, the average browsing temperature of the laptop is between 55c-60c and while playing game it is between 72c-78c, goving beyond 80c at times. With the cooler on, it is aorund 50c-55c for normal use and browsing, while 65c-70/71c while playing the games which I have mentioned above.2. Sound quality is s big let down.3. HP Service center is poor. I reached out to HP assistant and they told me clearly thats it's a hardware issue, plz ask Amazon to replace it. Also the waiting time during 2AM IST, is about 45 mins. I walked down to a HP store, they took their hands off, stating I am the first customer complaining about this model :D4. Battery backup with the replacement for normal browsing is still around 3.5 hours.As a user, you have 3 choices - 1) if you prefer hardcore gaming, go for gaming laptop. 2) If gaming is not a preference, there is another model that's around 5k less from HP, with just Integratred Intel Iris xe, please go ahead with that. 3) Someone like me, who wants light gaming and general purpose laptop, you may opt out for this as the other brands with same config will cost you 10-15k more ""BUT"" be prepared to face consequences and limitations. Hope this helps :)"
1,"After 10 days of buying this laptop, I am facing issue with its speakers. The speakers are not working anymore. Earlier also I faced similar issue, but that was resolved after restarting the laptop. But this time I restarted multiple times but still not working. The diagnostic tool doesn't diagnose anything. Have written to HP support team, let's see if they can help here.Battery LifeWith normal usage of video watching, the laptop shows low battery in approx 2 hours, as against claim of around 6 hours.HP Service CenterHP Service center is too slow. I bought this on October 8 and raised an issue on October 26, since then my issues are not resolved yet. My laptop has been taken by the service center. Not sure how many days they will take to replace the mother board."
5,"Pros: Fast, Adequate battery, Display clarity, light weight ( Subjective to individuals), Sound is awesome, NVIDIA boosts it's capabilities.Cons: No Touch screen, SSD could have been been better with 1TB."
5,"Hello allFirstly I'll like to tell that this is one of best product from hp that's out there. I went with 2gb graphic card one. Activating office is little tricky, else everything works on getgoIf you don't want graphic card then you can go for ryzen 5 version which is around 20k cheaper than this one.Best laptop in 14 inch category, period!"
5,Best Laptop At this price range Display quality is awesome and overall laptop I am giving 5/5 But there one thing that is about battery according to specifications of laptop I should get 6 to 7 hours of battery backup but I am getting only 2 to 3 hours only else everything is fine.
4,"Good things first. Super light, snappy fast, updated to windows 11 in just two days of purchase, and apt for media consumption and office work. Now for negatives. Costly, battery life sucks crazy (just about 4 hrs when in good luck), and an irritating issue with audio codes that one can't use speakers at times after booting up, needing a restart to get it going and finally bluetooth connectivity issues with headsets (tried a few by the way before I made this remark). Since I was one of the first few to buy this Laptop when no reviews were around, so blindly went with specs and got a hammer hard on my head now. For a better price and good specs, pls look elsewhere and keep away from this crap."
5,"A super thin laptop with premium look light weight and beautiful specs .I bought the ryzen 5 5500 varient with dedicated 2 GB nvidia mx450 graphics .It cost me around 63kINR .The bezels r Matt Black with compromised quality it should have looked better in glossy finish like many hp laptops  .The windows 11 update came right after turning it on and was even easy to activate  MS office. The only thing to complain is its battery and lack of a sd card reader  , it may give u hardly 4.2hrs of battery with minimal usage of application and may even give less if ur trying to multitask . It will charge near 0-80% within 60 to 70mts with the provided charger and  didn't try using the type C charger as I don't have one . If someone is planning to use a type C normal phone charger sorry ,it won't even recognise since it does not have sufficient power, so I asked hp regarding this and they they told me to use a hp dedicated type c charger or similar which has to be bought separate. u can always use ur lap to reverse charge ur Airpods ,neckbands , etc etc even at sleep or shutdown .But still the one charger solution in this lap is atleast distant for now .I was having minor issues with software which got rectified after a Bios update after calling  the hp support. This laptop will be an excellent fit for college students , IT professionals who does coding , and those who have  to travel and work being light . Don't expect this to be a full-time gaming laptop as it won't gives u a seamless experience , still it can mange most of the games. This is a light weight thin laptop and is not designed for gamers  .The heat dissipation seems ok so far and I have not met with major issues .The keyboard is good but not satisfying unlike many ,the key travel is ok and comes with two way adjustable back light.Finger print reader works easy most of the time .I will recommend to go for a buy if u can forgive few of the above points , otherwise excellent specs within affordable price and good aesthetics .

3,"I bought this laptop during the sale just before Indepedence day sale. I have basic perspectives. My old Asus I3 was over 4 years old and was becoming slow. Coming from IT background, I wanted to purchase a laptop with good RAM, that will help me in my academics and I wanted the laptop to be moderately lighweight having provision for basic gaming. After extensive research through Amazon, finally I narrowed down to this laptop becuase it also had dedicated MX450 graphics on top of Intel Iris Xe dedicated graphics.The laptop worked well as long as basic browsing happened. the moment i started playing the videos, it will heat up, and most importantly, when I started doing light gaming, the laptop will become a baked oven, the fan will stop and boom, it will die. I tried changing settings, modifying power management in Settings, nothing would work.Now by light gaming, I mean ""Tell Me Why"" (2019 game). I do a lot of gaming in my PS4, so I can say with conviction that decision making games like these won't make much use of hardware graphics. I tried Alan Wake from 2011, the result was the same :( Both games were tried through Steam, not pirated ones.Alos, the battery would die in 2.5 - 3 hours on normal use.I called Amazon customer care and this is where they had been trully brilliant. I was initially told that the replacement policy is over by few hours, but they evetually understood my problem and scheduled a technician visit post which, they promised to replace the laptop, through the extended window. the technican delayed the process, again I called up Amazon, this time they went above and beyond and they staright away issued the replacement. Thanks a bunch to Amazon.Once the replacement came, I could see that the power chord was a different one, hence battery management was better. But the laptop heat issue won't go away., while playing games. Hence I had to bring in a laptop cooler to suffice it.Hence, long story cut short - HP has build a product to capture the market well, becuase if you compare with other brands, you won't get a configuration like this, that too with 1.41kg, reminding you that this is not a gaming laptop. But, while doing so, this product has undergone poor testing resulting in not so great quality.Pros:1. Great Display. I like watching movies through VLC, or Netflix /Prime, downlaoded through WQindows App Store.2. Might Sound cliche, but the WIndows 10 is super fast.3. The boot time is between 8-10 secs.4. Comes with Office 2019, just need to activate it.5. I have tried few academics related software and basic video editing, it really works well.6. 16GB RAM is a blessing.7. 2 GB RAM does support basic gaming, at least doing well for my replaced laptop.Cons:1. While playing game, get yourself prepared to face lot of pain. I had repalced my laptop once, and now bought a cooler to suppress the heat while playing. On ""HWMonitor"" software, the average browsing temperature of the laptop is between 55c-60c and while playing game it is between 72c-78c, goving beyond 80c at times. With the cooler on, it is aorund 50c-55c for normal use and browsing, while 65c-70/71c while playing the games which I have mentioned above.2. Sound quality is s big let down.3. HP Service center is poor. I reached out to HP assistant and they told me clearly thats it's a hardware issue, plz ask Amazon to replace it. Also the waiting time during 2AM IST, is about 45 mins. I walked down to a HP store, they took their hands off, stating I am the first customer complaining about this model :D4. Battery backup with the replacement for normal browsing is still around 3.5 hours.As a user, you have 3 choices - 1) if you prefer hardcore gaming, go for gaming laptop. 2) If gaming is not a preference, there is another model that's around 5k less from HP, with just Integratred Intel Iris xe, please go ahead with that. 3) Someone like me, who wants light gaming and general purpose laptop, you may opt out for this as the other brands with same config will cost you 10-15k more ""BUT"" be prepared to face consequences and limitations. Hope this helps :)"
1,"After 10 days of buying this laptop, I am facing issue with its speakers. The speakers are not working anymore. Earlier also I faced similar issue, but that was resolved after restarting the laptop. But this time I restarted multiple times but still not working. The diagnostic tool doesn't diagnose anything. Have written to HP support team, let's see if they can help here.Battery LifeWith normal usage of video watching, the laptop shows low battery in approx 2 hours, as against claim of around 6 hours.HP Service CenterHP Service center is too slow. I bought this on October 8 and raised an issue on October 26, since then my issues are not resolved yet. My laptop has been taken by the service center. Not sure how many days they will take to replace the mother board."
5,"Pros: Fast, Adequate battery, Display clarity, light weight ( Subjective to individuals), Sound is awesome, NVIDIA boosts it's capabilities.Cons: No Touch screen, SSD could have been been better with 1TB."
5,"Hello allFirstly I'll like to tell that this is one of best product from hp that's out there. I went with 2gb graphic card one. Activating office is little tricky, else everything works on getgoIf you don't want graphic card then you can go for ryzen 5 version which is around 20k cheaper than this one.Best laptop in 14 inch category, period!"
5,Best Laptop At this price range Display quality is awesome and overall laptop I am giving 5/5 But there one thing that is about battery according to specifications of laptop I should get 6 to 7 hours of battery backup but I am getting only 2 to 3 hours only else everything is fine.
4,"Good things first. Super light, snappy fast, updated to windows 11 in just two days of purchase, and apt for media consumption and office work. Now for negatives. Costly, battery life sucks crazy (just about 4 hrs when in good luck), and an irritating issue with audio codes that one can't use speakers at times after booting up, needing a restart to get it going and finally bluetooth connectivity issues with headsets (tried a few by the way before I made this remark). Since I was one of the first few to buy this Laptop when no reviews were around, so blindly went with specs and got a hammer hard on my head now. For a better price and good specs, pls look elsewhere and keep away from this crap."
5,"A super thin laptop with premium look light weight and beautiful specs .I bought the ryzen 5 5500 varient with dedicated 2 GB nvidia mx450 graphics .It cost me around 63kINR .The bezels r Matt Black with compromised quality it should have looked better in glossy finish like many hp laptops  .The windows 11 update came right after turning it on and was even easy to activate  MS office. The only thing to complain is its battery and lack of a sd card reader  , it may give u hardly 4.2hrs of battery with minimal usage of application and may even give less if ur trying to multitask . It will charge near 0-80% within 60 to 70mts with the provided charger and  didn't try using the type C charger as I don't have one . If someone is planning to use a type C normal phone charger sorry ,it won't even recognise since it does not have sufficient power, so I asked hp regarding this and they they told me to use a hp dedicated type c charger or similar which has to be bought separate. u can always use ur lap to reverse charge ur Airpods ,neckbands , etc etc even at sleep or shutdown .But still the one charger solution in this lap is atleast distant for now .I was having minor issues with software which got rectified after a Bios update after calling  the hp support. This laptop will be an excellent fit for college students , IT professionals who does coding , and those who have  to travel and work being light . Don't expect this to be a full-time gaming laptop as it won't gives u a seamless experience , still it can mange most of the games. This is a light weight thin laptop and is not designed for gamers  .The heat dissipation seems ok so far and I have not met with major issues .The keyboard is good but not satisfying unlike many ,the key travel is ok and comes with two way adjustable back light.Finger print reader works easy most of the time .I will recommend to go for a buy if u can forgive few of the above points , otherwise excellent specs within affordable price and good aesthetics . Definitely value for money . This is not a long time user review .Will add the rest after a while ."

4,"This is the review of the 16-e0162AX model [ AMD Ryzen 5 with Radeon RX5500M GPU ]The system is exactly the same as the GTX 1650 variant except for the GPU.  In papers Radeon RX5500M is better than GTX 1650.For the first impression, I like the overall design of the laptop.The screen looks fantastic.  One of the major issue highlighted is the refresh rate but I do play games with PS4 connected to my TV / Projector and they are all 60 Hz only and I don't find it really botheringKeyboard is fun to type.  Its backlit but only single color and brightness.  The power button is part of the keyboard layout which requires us to be careful not to press it while trying to use the function keysThe trackpad is one of the best I would say.  While typing this comment, multiple times my palm have pressed the trackpad but it didn't interfered [Awesome].  The tracking was smooth.

Beware. Buy something else."
1,My laptop became dead after 18 days and service centre told motherboard issue and after 5 days also they are not doing anything.. Too nonsense..
5,"Good value for money.Processor and graphics card don't lag until you do some extreme graphics gaming. Good for beginner to moderate gamers.I also do coding, no issues there too.Battery life feels a little less as it lasts about 3.5 to 4 hours.Speakers are loud and clear. Touchpad and keyboard is good.Little heavy to carry and fits exactly in regular backpacks.It looks very nice."
4,Overall its a good product. The specifications at this price range is competitive. Other brands or models with this specs are around 6-8k costlier.Only drawback i can see is the battery life. Battery runs out in between 1 to 1.5 hours.
5,"First update BIOS,and windows.You will see good battery back up.Else you will see battery drains within one hour.I am not playing games. For coding simulation purpose its performance is good."
5,"Bought this a week back.Except for the weak battery life, this laptop is value for money.It has a decent graphics card to run games like RDR2 at 30-50 fps, Forza Horizon 4 at 65-70 fps on ultra settings. Older games run even better. The build is decent. Overall a good buy under 70k"
5,Bang for the buck.... This machine is üî•üî•No heating issue at all and the this laptop is smooth af giving great fps during heavy gaming.
4,Over All product is very good...Gaming Good..Build Quality Good.Keypad well designed ...Track pad quality is okay okay  better use mouse for best performance.
5,"Battery life is short.Rest all is very good, fast loading , easy to use, design and many more.Buy it if you want for normal use at reasonable cost."
4,"For this price range, this is one of the best products to opt for if you are interested in gaming/online class/daily chores, basically for students and regular use."

4,"Good Product and Servies. I ordered the product in March. It worked fine. Easy and convenient to use. Though I faced some issue , bit it was under warranty and after sending for repair, they sent me new product. It is working good now. It is a Indian brand and we can give it a try. It is worth the price as I got it for 15k."

4,"Overall it's a good laptop. Just one thing about screen, if we put the laptop on high place and watch it from below clearity decreases."
4,"The laptop superb in terms of performance. Useful for any office work, programming, mid-range gaming etc.. Battery life is about 4-5 hours depending on use..However, display panel technology is outdated. This will not useful if the work is color intensive."
5,"The internal storage is not big so of course you‚Äôre not able to put much files. But I‚Äôm only using for basic school works and videocall (classes). And for watching movies and stuffs, everything is available online and apps are there so I really don‚Äôt download anything. It‚Äôs fast and switching from one app to another is smooth and fast. Load apps fast too."
5,"At this price (49.99 K) its an awsome buy, Only 2 days now, Windows and Office 2019 home and student life time warranty. Flawless working, Only thing is SSD should have been 512 gb.  Scope for expansikn : RAM can only be ipgraded up to 12 gb and there is no space for HDD, only existing SSD can be replaced to 512 gb or 1 tb. I recommend you to buy min 512 gb ssd. No lag, Booting very fast, thanks to 256 gb SSD.  I strongly recommend this product."
5,Na
4,Nice laptop with good features but battery could be improved as I got only 5 hrs SOT where my office laptop got around 12 hrs SOT.
3,"The makers of this product are too smart, they have, despite giving a slot for expansion have expanded the battery in that place because of which you cannot expand the storage (HDD)... Other than this the product is very very cool with some great features."
4,Out of 256 gb ssd 196gb available....Screen quality not good..i got this in 47k.So intel i5 is present ...so performance is super fine.Build quality is plastic...built quality could have been better...
4,Some more improvements have to be done but at this price is very very very good laptop hundred percent you should buy with close your eyes
2,"Well, I had high hopes after reading through all the reviews and comments but it turned out to be a disappointment.Poor screen quality.No proper batter backupi5 with 8 GB ram and still hangs sometimesOverall other better options are available at this range."
4,"This laptop replaced my MacBook Air. And hardware wise, it hasn't disappointed me, yet. Great specs, fast boot, quick response, good build quality, decent customer support by brand."
1,Not good
3,"Ok product, but robustness of screen frame and assembly is not good. Even the audio quality is too low,"
4,"Its Ok for the price and for normal usage, bit slow to start after couple of weeks"
5,Everything is awesome
1,"The customer service for Lenovo is pathetic, raised a call multiple times. Ideally the laptop should had been replaced as the one sent to us is defective but the company values money instead of customer."
4,GOOD
3,Overall experience was good but the display of this laptop was too poor. Kindly request to lenovo please upgrade the display nits quality of this laptop.
4,"Purchased 1 month back, it's working smooth till now.Booting time is less than 5 sec.Battery, speed, overall good performance."
5,Laptop work nicely for coding point of view.Thanks for the deal @Amazon
4,actual storage(237GB) could have been a bit more..
5,Great product
4,"Good , worth for money"
4,Poor quality display
5,Very super laptop.
4,Good
2,Major issue is quality of customer care. You have to dial multiple numbers to get any kind of a resolution. So beware.
5,"Made the best decision of purchasing this affordable machine. Quick boot up, great for working on Microsoft Office and entertainment. The FHD display makes binging my favourite shows on Netflix a pleasant experience and the bezels are narrow so the screen is always in my focus. The sound quality is good and the backlit keyboard aids in working during the night. Friends recommended i5 11th Gen processor over the 10th Gen or i3 and the difference in performance is evident. With all my subscriptions I hardly store any movies on the laptop and 256gb  storage is more than enough."
5,"Ordered this yesterday, it is a super light and fast laptop. i5 11th Gen processor is super zippy and the 256GB SSD helps in fast boot up. 256GB is more than enough storage for me, you will be surprised as to how less of storage that we actually use. The display is great with FHD resolution and 250 Nits display and with very narrow bezels. The sound quality is good. The laptop comes with a backlit keyboard which is a nice touch. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon."
1,The laptops have hardware issues. Not recommended to buy at all. I had different model which needs hardware repair every 2-3 months.
1,1. windows not getting updated2. Screen display randomly switching on/off3. Needed to reinstall windows on day1 as the laptop lost its password file for no reason
5,Excellent product..Superfast..Good for programmers too..For gaming I am not sure but otherwise best laptop in this price range..It's worth every penny..
1,"Not worth buying as the battery drains out within 3.30 hours of usage despite the fact that they claim 9 hours of battery usage on the official HP website.The keypad gets heat up immediately after logging in.Display resolution and camera quality are also poor.Facing problem for the replacement of the product regarding the above mentioned issues- not yet replaced, still waiting for replacement. Conversation with amazon is also not satisfactory and is misguiding.Overall product is pathetic, disgusting and is a waste of money. my opinion is not to buy this rubbish product.Got the product replaced. Now performing much better, battery drains out in 6.30 hours as compared to the previous one which drains out in 3.30 hours. Heating up of the laptop body is also reduced significantly."
4,This was a great upgrade from my i3. I7 is a much better and faster processor. Laptop starts on a few seconds. 1 tb ssd snd 16 GB ram is a great combination.It looks beautiful and premium very thin and relatively lightweight.Good combination at this price
5,"This is an awesome product from HP.It run very smooth, i purchase it for software development and i run Visual studio, Sql Server Management Studio, Chrome, Docker, Kubernetes, onedrive and many more application simultaneously and the laptop is running very smooth and fast.I recommend this laptop to anyone if he/she is buying for software development, this will be a best option."
5,The best laptop I ever seen. Brightness is very greater than I expected. it gives battery life of 5 hours with is good. It is very very light weight. The best thing is in performance it give smooth experience while running heavy softwares also. At this price 79499 rs this is the best value for money laptop
4,"It‚Äôs light weight, i7 11th gen laptop. The battery life is good till now. The processor speed is 2.8Ghz.Below are few of my dislikes- It‚Äôs only 14 inch- There is no CD room- The graphics card is Intel Iris- The processor speed is 2.8Ghz not 4.7 mentioned."
4,Battery Life improved to 5-6 hrs after using for a month..Amazing perfomance
5,"1. Its light in weight easy to carry & due to core i7 processing is fast.2. Starting on and shut down, navigation to different browsers, application ,file copying all are swift.3. Backlight keyboard is a good feature & silver color adds more beauty to the looks of laptop.4. I can see many people complaining about processor speed shown as 2.80ghz but if they open task manager and see the speed it is really high. They need to run many applications to see the real speed.5. Only doubt is the headphone/mic jack as my 3.5 mm earphone is not entering so will be working with support team to find a solution.6. I am using many multiple VM's on this to see the performance & will post my views on this soon.7. I liked the laptop in many ways overall a satisfied product from HP in this budget."
5,"This laptop is good for Programmers and it is running like mac pro, smooth multitasking and battery life is good.Not for people who don't like 14 inch screen."
5,"I have been using this laptop for about 2 weeks now and can only say good things about it. I don't have to speak about configuration, that you all know is quite good. What additionally I can use is though it is not light or slim, but it is sleek and does not heat up while using, unlike other light and thin models."
3,"Product Cost : ExpensiveConfigurations : Good but not for people who is not into hard core gaming, product development, etc.Hardware : HP always gave hinges problem as this was my 3rd HP laptop.Battery : Completely gone in 3 years, replacement battery cost 9000+.My experience with this laptop was that mousepad was loose and display to monitor was not going through after update from 2nd day.Other suggestion : Dell Inspiron 5518 with Hexacore i5 without graphic card is perfect option for every user other than Product developer or High end gamer. Cost is low, product build sturdy, graphics good, configuration pretty good. I opted that after returning this.Amazon experience: Their technical team has not handled it well. As a suggestion, if you buy check your laptop thoroughly and arrange for technician visit in case of issues"
1,"This laptops heats a lot from day 1, settings & BIOS updates etc, wont work, fan makes noise and throws air continuously ... i replaced the laptop but in the replaced laptop also same issues even in bigger form...lot of heat , air and fan nosie....  Amazon & delivery agents are not supportive regarding return, its been more than 4 times coordinated with Amazon for return, everytime return rescheduled because delivery agent dint come also they will mention the reason that you are not ready with return (false reasons for not picking return)Pathetic experience of Laptop + Amazon service, would suggest not to buy laptop from Amazon!"
1,"The display of colours, clarity of images and videos was far below expected for this premium laptop if it was a manufacturing problem for the specific laptop delivered to me. USB port for Bluetooth connectivity was faulty and could not connect to the mouse bluetooth adaptor"
5,"My first choice was to take Microsoft Surface. Instead, I have got the highest configured 14-inch laptop for the same price that Microsoft Surface Laptop doesn't. Comparatively, HP provides a high quality, light weighted laptop for a reasonable price. Worth grabbing it."
1,It's not even a month I bought this new laptop & am facing laptop shutdown issues frequently & on restart it don't save session before shutdown & I loose all work....on Googling I find reason to be related to internal power supply issue(I don't have power outage @ home but it's has to do with internal power supply) very disappointed to see such pathetic product after paying so high amount.
1,"Did not like anything about this laptop....price, keyboard layout, hp support, customer is a joker.... customers are just there to generate revenue for these manufacturers..."
5,Best as i have expected.I only trust Hp for laptopsPros1. Light weight2. Amazing display3. Smooth experience4. Keyboard5. Easy to carry6. Superb performance for business purposes or designing purposeCons1. Battery not that much satisfactory2. Safe old charger3. Plastic body but still look metal finish4. If you don't have this laptop at this moment its your loss.5. MOST FRUSTRATING IS HEATING ISSUEI am satisfied with the quality and durability.
4,"It's a good laptop within the price range.11th generation i7 with 1TB SSD for 85k is nice deal.All the below things are good:1. Display2. Laptop body ( does not feel like plastic though other reviews stats that)3. Excellent performance ( worked on development tool parallely, no issues)4. Comfortable keypadOnly concern is backup battery life which is around 4 hours with full charge."
1,"It is really wastage of money, this machine is not worth it. It's just 3-4 months and it is creating an issue, it is giving a blue screen issue of death, upon contacting the helpdesk they suggested to re-install the operating system and I did that but again after 10-15 days issue again re-started coming.I am trusted with this machine and not getting any help from HP support. Their call wait time is killing.I would request HP to please return my hard earn money and take away your junk box.Request amazon to consider this request and help to resolve this issue."
4,"I am software engineer mainly working on Citrix. Using this laptop for work. No problem with screen resolution, after working for 8 hours on average mode battery drops to 20% . No heating issues so far, amazing speakers, it's super fast laptop. Only camera is of low quality, but zoom meeting seems to give bearable experience.To conclude, it's best business laptop for windows users. I chose this over MacBook Air M1 because I have always been windows user and I needed best specifications like blazing speed, loud speakers, many ports, 16GB RAM, large and fast SSD, dual monitor connectivity etc. This is the best we can get. Hope this review helps people."
1,Laptop generates lot of heat.At this heft price tag this is unacceptable.
3,"This is the review after 2 days of useIt's lightweight and looks robust.Installed a few resource hungry softwares (DaVinci resolve) and no issues noticed till now.In day light, don't forget to switch-off the keypad back lights, else you won't recognize the keys! Also, after using touch screens for quite some time, working without touch support cause confusion at times.. but considering the price and other features, I guess it's fine.This will be good for programmers or mid kevel video editing works (if you got an additional monitor). The only problem I faced, tried connecting a 2nd led screen with HDMI and not detecting it as a second screen. Voice also not working while connected to second screen."
3,Do go by the looks of the laptop.  Only 2 USB port and another 1 type 3 port and it seems not compatible with my current docking station.Screen can't be titled downward. Restricted Screen.  Old design.Display is good. Performance so far ok ok ok. I prefer some alternatives.
2,"******* Don't buy this product ********I have purchased this product from Amazon on July 2021. But the problem is that getting blue screen frequently with some error message and also unable to contact customer care directly, So I‚Äôm frustrated with these errors now. Because getting errors while working with important tasks.My return date also completed , So unable to return this item here and also unable to contact customer care directly. Always chatting with useless virtual agent."
5,"It is the best laptop everFast bootupGood displayAwesome in built speakersSilver finished antique look and paper lightSuper backlit keyboardExtreme space for mouseGood for programersBetter than expected for gamingSuper webcam with flashBuilt in progamming related stuff ,artificial intelligence packagesOverall super laptop computer"
5,"This was the only laptop available with i7, 1tb ssd and 16gb Ram.  Its reasonably light weight. Boot time is very fast and fingerprint sensor is a boon, very helpful.Over all a good purchase for 70k. Performance is good. Looks are average."
1,I've been using the product for 3 days now. It's fast and good.The port in the right seems to have gone inside and I'm unable to use anything on that side. So now I have only one input port. Whom am I to contact? I have tried to return the product and call all possible numbers. I need some response.
4,Laptop with great config and looks. Only think I felt HP should have given with this is Laptop Bag along with the laptop.
5,"I think this is the most advance notebook one can get ,In such a priceHP GERMAN , PLUS i7Graphic quality is superb ,Overheating systems are superb , once the laptop overheats at a level it cuts the power automatically,Restarts whenever you feel its cold,The first time i saw this feature ,Lightweight, Easy to carry ,HP Pavillion i7 is a bond notebook"
5,"If you are student have a lot of excel modelling to do, multi-task to do GO FOR IT.If you are working professional looking to work on multiple applications without Lag GO FOR IT.I don't think there is any brand out there currently giving so much at 85k as HP is giving."
5,"Very light weight, value for money."
4,"The product has good specifications. Although the price appeared a bit high (85k), the features are worth going for. Superfast usage because of processor and RAM. Camera quality is not great. In addition, the screen cannot be tilted/folded much."
5,"Very thin, very light, starts quickly, smooth keypad, laptop works fast. Since now its new , so not facing any heating issue for now. Only limitation is the non-availability of number keypad (since its a 13.5 inch laptop). Those who are habituated of using number keypad may find it uncomfortable a bit for sometime. But to ease that, one may buy external keyboard. Rest everything is awesome."
5,Everything's upto the mark especially the battery backup (Quick charging and easily runs for 6-7 hours for heavy development works and watching movies on single charge).But needs a lot of work in heat handling as you won't be able to use it for more than 15-20 mins on your lap without feeling the heat as the heat vent is on the bottom of laptop.
1,"From day 1 I m updating it , and it's not workingWindows getting freezedUsb port not workingAndIN HP YOU HAVE ALL BUT YOU CAN find service station or any mode to raise complaint.. when you raise complaint they will make to dontroublsoots every time nd will take your whole day..Window will take whole night to update and thereafter window will get freezed .. you can do anythingI am going back on Mac Book andI will make sure I will sue Amazon, H.p and seller to sell such a pathetic product"
5,"The laptop seems to be very good for a regular usage. The battery lasts long for a normal use and it charges quickly. The screen is wonderful and the keyboard is soothing. Overall, best laptop in this range."
1,The laptop is not starting after a month and the service quality is very bad. I lost 85k for nothing. Amazon has very bad after sales service and I will suggest everyone to purchase from retail stores where at least they will cooperate with you
4,"One of the best laptops available .-Battery life is of 3 to 4 hrs max but has fast charging so no worries .-Fingerprint sensor is very nice .-Camera is ok not to shabby but not to good also just enough to have a vedio chat .Rest everything is awesomeNOTE : if you want to play heavy games then it goes max up to nfs payback, battlefield 5 after that the application will crash üòÄ"

1,"From the first day battery had degradation ..discharges quickly.. had an issue with external display connectivity..some light bleed issues on screen..then some charging issues//and then the system stopped working..and not turning on.. totally clueless! so all the pros about this device in the previous review get vanished in this review!tried to get it replaced..but amazon has printed the wrong serial number on the warranty and invoice for verification(everyone do a check-up and get it corrected)... this caused replacement not possible. very sad experience!had to return this.. a very troublesome return experience..but very possible I must say!

Hoping for the best!Hp envy x360 is heavier... but performance is top-notch with AMD! Even without a thunderbolt port connects two external monitors easily.

5,"This is super machine with lightest possible form factor. No lag, no hang ,no complaints till date!"
3,The build quality seems to be not as per the expectation for this price. Plastic seems to be so thin and of poor quality. Backside of the screen and overall body is not strong enough for what you pay. Performance seems to be good.

1,"Poor battery backup. The product while installation done the warranty shows only 22 months left on the first day of delivery itself. Why and how I don‚Äôt know. Speed performance is not up to the mark and it hangs some time. Wonder if I was delivered a. Refurbished product. The mic won‚Äôt work properly, the cursor won‚Äôt move properly"
4,"Product is good when you compare with the price27999. performance is okay for basic task if you're buying this for other than basic work then big no.The biggest con is build quality is very low. It's definitely not a travel friendly, cheap plastic is used but you can't expect more at this price range.Display is good and battery also good last at least for 6hour if you're using it for the basic task.overall I'm okay with this product."
4,It is lighter than my 13 inch metal body laptop. Sturdy and good looking. Serves the purpose well. Only downside is brightness in the outdoors. Compared to my another laptop with glossy reflective screen this screen is dull. Apart from this all are good.
4,For an i3 seems faster due to m.2 SSD. But I can't add an second SSD for storage due to 3900mha battry installed bye default.üòÇüòÖ

4,This one is really a powerhouse with great capabilities. The ryzen processor inside does good job working with multiple tasks
5,Very Good and satisfied
5,The laptop was in excellent condition. Packed really well. It is as good as a brand new laptop. All technical configurations were as described. It is pretty fast too. I was bit sceptical about buying refurbished ones but this purchase has made me trust the sellers and brands and of course Amazon for partnering with genuine sellers.
5,I am writing this review after 1 week of using the product. Laptop is in a very good condition. Response time is very less and it works swiftly. I got windows 10 Pro and MS office installed.I must say it is worth buying. Beneficial purchase.After using one product I bought 2nd after 15 days. Product is working superfine and enjoying this high end product at this reasonable cost.
5,When i added to the cart the price was showing 21990. When payment option came it was showing 23990.  I did not bother to cancel because of my urgent necessity. Bag was also not there. Eventhough it is renewed item there was not a scrach.  128 GB space was not sufficient.  Battery and overall performance is so far so good.  Later on there was a call from rentopc.com asking for the working condition.
5,Happy to get this refurbished product in almost new like condition. Moreover the customer support on the product has been very prompt and professional.....
5,"The lsptop is as good as a new one, fast, compact and light weight."
4,The battery lasts about2-2.5 hrs for general on work with regular sync. Mild heating on long usage. Ssd provided runs the laptop at optimum speed even on i3.Only downside was the wear and tear found exceeds the expected range.
5,Laptop is as it is mentioned in description.. Working perfectly fine and in a new condition only.. satisfied with the product.. looking forward to recommend the same to other people as well.. battery life is perfect till now..I am using it now from last one week atleast.. working great for me..

4,It is light weight and easy to carry.It is acceptable for the value of money.great keypad.durability of battery is high iam surprised.
1,"Worst experience. I bought this laptop from Appario retail, direct Amazon seller (not from the third party seller). Amazon delivery is good as usual.This laptop worked fine for just two months. Facing display issues,  the laptop screen is dark now with zero brightness. It works on the external monitor. Tried all sort of troubleshooting, all the drivers are up to date. Went thru all videos from official HP support site. Please dont buy this product or its variant by seeing 4+ rating.Update: visited HP service center, they removed the screen from the laptop and ordered a replacement for it. Now the laptop looks exactly like a refurbished one. The service staff laughs and casually tells me that this kind of issue happen in Apple products as well."
1,"There are things to like about the laptop, like 16GB RAM and a powerful processor. But I came across shortcomings that make it not so great buy if you are a software developer, artist or designer, a movie buff, or a power user. Reasons below:1. The screen is anti glare which means muted colors. The viewing experience isn't great. A glossy screen can be converted to anti glare by applying film but not vice versa. So if you also intend to do a lot of content creation or watch movies and videos or for photo editing, this might not be a good purchase.2. Non standard keyboard layout. There is an extra column of keys on the right, and that makes the typing experience unusual. You will get used to it over time, but that means you will no longer be productive on a standard layout and struggle with other computers.3. USB Type C port is not of much use. Personally, my biggest issue with this laptop. You can't use it directly with a USB Type C Monitor. This is something my Rs 20k, 3 year old, Chromebook and Rs 240k MacBook, both, can do with ease. HP Support instead suggested that I buy a USB Type C to DisplayPort adapter and then run my monitor on DisplayPort instead of USB Type C. This isn't really a modern way of doing things, and I regret my purchase.On top of it HP support isn't up to mark either. Their chat support is quite slow and simple requests might take hours of work. Email support creates a new thread and issue number with each reply. Moreover they send their replies in a couple of days, not promptly. They don't have an on site warranty for this, so you can't really ask them to come and see the issue.All put together, a bad purchase for me. I will not recommend if you need a modern machine that would be perfect for your work, or value your time in general."
2,"I got this laptop on 13th July 2021, laptop overall performance is good but when it's comes to battery it's discharge percentage is not showing properly. It's stucks at same percentage up-to 30 to 40 mins and then it's changing. Better not  buying this product and I got replacement on this  product ,Amazon service is very good. They responded very well and replaced the item.Now I'm just checking this new replaced laptop."
3,Bought this laptop and has started freezing suddenly. Usually happens when battery is low. Still thinking if I should return this or keep it. The packaging was good though when it arrived.Everything else is working smoothly but it has frozen twice now in the 1st week itself.
4,"16 GB RAM + 512 SSD + 11th Gen processor + Quick charge + Backlit keyboard + Fingerprint = Total Value for money.Pros:Superfast bootingCompact laptop - bezels are thin, smartly moved speakers to bottom which saves a lot of space for the large keys.Crystal clear LED screenNo heating issues (till now)Fast chargingBacklit keyboard with 2 brightness settingsCons (in general, none is a deal breaker for me)No LAN portonly 2 USB (Type A) slotsNo scroll in touchpad"
5,"Its a premium looking laptop. You will feel proud to open it in front of everyone. Processor i5, 16 GB RAM, and SSD makes this laptop superfast. Body feels nice but it's not very strong. I kept it carelessly and it got two deep scratches. Anyways it was my mistake.People who want to use virtual machine can go for this laptop but then you will face shortage of storage."
5,I  bought the HP laptop for personal use. Installation is super easy. Totally DIY. Windows 10 64bit + Office home edition is pre loaded. Speed is excellent due to 16GB RAM and it Processor. Display quality is superb. Very lightweight. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,I am satisfied with this purchase. The laptop comes with great configuration for personal and business use. As a plus point it looks cute as well. Overall satisfied with the purchase
5,"I retired my 6 year old Dell and upgraded to this beauty. I was expecting it to be faster but not this - it is blazing fast. I am a techie and as a developer, this beast it is simply there.Very good screen-to-size ratio. Suggest setting the ""Display Scaling"" to 125% instead of the default 150% for best screen utilization. The brightness needs to be set to 100%, this could be improved.Great laptop overall. Amazon delivery and pricing are just bonus on top."
5,"- Excellent performance. Laptop boots up in just 10 secs- Lightning fast storage.- RAM is on the higher sideOwned a Dell 5000 series laptop before this. Complared to Dell, HP laptop has been very good, have been using it for 3 months now. The build quality is good and the laptop is light weight."
4,"laptops comes with good configuration for the price. boots up very fast . it is compact and light weight.missing privacy shutter for web cam. in outdoor it is difficult to use, as screen is dull even in max brightness.build quality is ok but  does not give the confidence that it will last for long. keyboard and touchpad response is good. Battery lasts between 4 to 6 hrs based on usage."
3,"Data transfer speed in the machine is very poor, Poor than HDD. I tried unzip a file of 600mb.Which took around 40 min more than my HDD Old laptop. System Boot speed is good. Sound is good. Battery life is good. I doubt the SSD. Except that all is good."
5,"I took some time to use it before writing a review. And so far, I love it. It's very sleek and pretty. It also runs smoothly. Set up was incredibly easy. And thankfully it doesn't lag even with 3000 frames running with music and internet (yet). For the prize, it's perfect."
1,It was sparingly used and suddenly the desply went off today. It tought me a lesson never ever spend money on online purchase High rated gadgets. Had it been in HP store it would have helped me to go for replacement.
2,Laptop heat bhut hota hai or now 17 days then laptop not working amzon say im not responsible for so mai sucide kr raha hu abhi üò´üò´üò´üò´üò´
3,Every thing is good but build quality with that muc price tag..it's really bad. I will suggest don't buy it because when you are going to pick this laptop you will just feel the bad Material used. Never seen such build quality even in lower prices laptop. I can't return other wise definitely I would have returned due to only one reason i.e. built quality.
5,"Just go for it, great for kids, wifi 6 makes it ultra fast. You can live with this version for next 3 years. Must take warranty with ADP included. Great one from HP."
2,The screen constantly black outs and revives after a few seconds. I returned the laptop and got another one. The same issue was observed in the second unit as well. Looks like a defect in this range.
4,"Except camera (‚Ä¶worst) all others like compute power, lightweight, etc. works well. Don‚Äôt understand why HP compromised on camera, which is a critical requirement especially working from home."
1,Great product but got a warranty pre activated laptop. Now I am not sure whether it new or used one. It shows the warranty from last month while checking in hp website
1,Laptop came in box which was fully damaged. Luckily laptop was safe. Internal laptop box was opened and tapped as if it was refurbished.
5,"I'm recommending this laptop to purchase. My old laptop was exchanged with this laptop and all encluding I got it in 57k.This laptop is best for office people, and students who are doing higher education. 16GB RAM makes it highly efficient. After 2 months of use, I'm giving feedback.The only demerit is overheating, which is I also experienced sometimes."
1,"After paying 65k, Could not use the system for a month now. First week itself system started restarting and third week its is completely down not booting at all and not in a position to replace. Contacting support and now HP support also is @ doorstep and takes its own time... very much frustrated after this purchase...."
5,It has all the latest generation hardware. It is a metal built body and looks very durable. The laptop is also very fast in performance and is sleek in design. Looks very attractive.
3,"Firstly I did not buy this for gaming so I comment on the gaming experience. It is definitely a really eye-catching laptop and it functions fast and smoothly.There were a few 'company setting' errors that I had to get resolved at a service center. Also, i am robbed of warranty as the Laptop's warranty began 7 months before my purchase. The battery life is not that great."

5,Received today.Such a excellent light weight laptop with AMD processor.Speed is good for the price.
5,Awesome laptop.Don't rely on negative reviews.Best student laptop available out there.
1,"Worst laptop dont buy, hanging often"
1,Many people had written positive reviews for this product which prompted me to buy this for my son for his online classes. Some had even advised that it is the antivirus that slows such entry level laptops down and uninstalling the AV would make it perfectly alright and I did all that. But all said and done this is a very poorly performing piece of equipment period.
4,"Very happy with this laptop, bought this under exchange, it was priced Rs. 1000 cheaper on Flipkart but somehow chose Amazon. The light weight, great screen definition and although being a 4gb RAM works pretty fast on heavy office applications. Heavy gamers not a machine for you! Love it!  Seller needs to match Flipkart prices."
5,Laptop is too good for college students as well as office work.packaging is damn good.Must try
2,The laptop seems to perform good when it comes to the Ryzen 3 processor and the 4GB inbuilt RAM. However the 1TB hard disk makes work or play extremely painful due to low speed of 5400 RPM. Upgraded to a 256GB SSD and performance has changed significantly in terms of Windows boot and routine operations. Review based on over 6 months of regular use.Reducing costs by downgrading the HDD speed looks like a very incorrect move by Acer for an otherwise decent set of specifications.
1,"Please return my orderIt's very very bad product ,please help amazon team india üôèüèªPlease call me amazon team indiaBecause there is no way to talk to youIt is very important to talk to you but there is no contact so please ,You said no cost but more interest,  Twenty-seven thousand purchases are increasing, but fifty thousand have been paid by credit cardPlease don't buy this product üìåüìåüìåüìå"
2,"It usually is slower even with the RAM upgrade, the bottle neck seems to be the disk., Nevertheless after a crash, only way to wake up the machine is the hard reset which means all your unsaved work gone without a trace.Been using it since months.. regret buying it."
5,awesome processor and design
1,I baught this laptop on 21 july 2021. for last 4 days I have been calling to all acer customer care to comlain and get service for a display issue. but after checking till four days...they told me that no guarantee/warrantee is available on this laptop as it is baught online...buy offline from authorized dealer for all warrantee related confirmations....disgusting.

4,Very nice laptop I am happy with this ..but Amazon tell me they will give in silver colour but it was black somehow it hurts me but the laptop is too good tysm Amazon
5,screen size is small
2,It's just 15inches not 15.6 btw
1,Poor build and slowest performance for even when browsing
4,Slim laptop. great performance but overpriced.
2,It's getting lag so muchI can't play GTA 5Poor performanceDon't buy it really
4,Excellent laptop in this price range
1,Waste of money. Do go for it if you are a daily user.Totally wastage of money.
4,"Look is premium, Display and camera is excellent."
5,I am very happy . Look wise very good. value for money this is no 1 .
3,"People for who thought of expanding memory in future, please do not buy this laptop, it does not support RAM memory expansion."
4,Laptop is good but bag is missing.
5,The best laptop in this price range !!!Processor-10/10Display-9/10Battery -10/10Fingerprint-10/10Build quality-9/10Speakers-10/10Overall Performance -10/10Best Buy.Go for it.
5,"Execellent Product, Great performance...!!"
5,"Look is great. Build quality is sturdy. Performance is as expected. Battery backup though varies between 6-8 hrs depending on usage for the ryzen 5 5500u model....over all I am satisfied.Also the haselfree exchange of old product made me a huge fan of Amazon unlike flipkart who were offering 1800 for same laptop after inspection, and Amazon exchanged for more than 9000"
1,"Please avoid buying this lenovo laptop. After weeks of research I finally felt I should take a chance and get AMD powered lenovo laptop. But to my disappointment, this is the worst possible laptop that I ever invested such a huge amount it. The display had a pixel defect within the 1st month of the purchase, after 3 weeks and 2 twitter escalations they finally replaced my screen and now I have frequent brightness problems with the laptop display. I am unable to experience the hardware the laptop comes with due to very poor display quality. This laptop is worse than the cheapest china product possible.The laptop charge overheats, very very poor support in case of assistance required and for the money spent, this is not at all worth it. You better scout for more options but not this laptop.Laptop is heavy, the 8 GB RAM is unresponsive sometimes leading to additional wait time to switch tabs between google chrome browser. It's not just me, but many have faced this issue. Lenovo is just not good at making premium products.My verdict, avoid this laptop. It's not worth the money and it will give up during the time you least expect and you can't do anything about it as support is also like 2-3 weeks duration long."
4,"Sturdy build quality. 5500u performs as advertised. Audio is clear and just about loud. Setting up office-19 was a bit of a hassle given the office 365 pop-ups. Can handle gaming at medium settings. Thermal management is pretty average. For the price, still a pretty good deal."
4,"I have this system from last 20 days so it will be premature to comment ,but so far it works smoothly ,boot time is fast no overheating but need to work on system to provide full review.FYI it take dust particles so need to keep it clean"
3,Screen quantity is not great.Rs. 500/- Amazon Pay voucher from Appario Retail not received
5,Excellent performance
4,"This laptop is great in terms of performance and is pretty fast in terms of opening up and shutting down and general operations. It looks sleek but following pointers to be notes:1. Display is not up to the mark. The tone of the display is not natural and the brightness level is just not sufficient.2. Speakers though Dolby Atmos but very average sound (both the quality of sound and especially the noise level/volume is average)Apart from the 2 things mentioned, this laptop is amazing and an easy recommendation for the price."
5,"I have been using for few months the processor is quite awesome,smooth and battery life is excellent.for student I recommend to take for their educational purpose if you want more storage better purchase an external hard dist for low budget we won't get this type of processor. I recommend to buy....."
5,This IdeaPad slim 5 notebook full classic and modern stylish laptop with powerful and efficient amd ryzen 5500u processor ..Battery backup 10/9.5Display 10/ 8.5Look 10/9.9Performance 10/8Keyboard  10/9
5,Really awesome üëå
4,only negatives are ram and ssd doesn't have extra slot. And display could have been better.
5,"A wonderful purchase, great look and feel. Amazing graphics & battery life. I would have liked more USB slots but I'm still very happy with the machine."
5,everything included in this prize and super fast and very handy laptop with good spec
5,"I purchased this product at 58k .. and overall I am happy with my design ,Battery backup of this laptop is awesome (almost 10 hr )"
4,"Amd ryzen 5500 performance is sufficient, battery lasts all day(8-10hrs average usage) build quality is decent display has a flex."
5,Personally don't like d anti glare display
2,"Performance is good, battery life is good, display quality is average.The most disappointing part is the screen shakes even under a normal fan. It continuously wobbles unless the fan is switched off."
5,Performance is really up to the markDisplay is just Awesome
1,Not satisfied with productFirst the screen brightness was not changing on first day then this irritating blue line appears on the screen
5,Excellent
4,Worth it!!
1,Microphone stopped working after windows update and hence Alexa not responding can't attend video calls. I bought this on 5 th May for video calls but the product failed in 20 days. Now I am stuck
5,"I got it for my son‚Äôs online classes as the primary use case. It works seamlessly and is compact. Really like the narrow bezel which makes my work laptop with same screen size appear bigger. Build is great. Only thing I don‚Äôt like is the quality of the mouse pad, it makes a rattling noise while clicking which I could live without. Overall a great product."
5,"I like the product, sleek and handy.Very stylish and good for studying purpose."
4,Today is Day 4 of using the laptop and has been working absolutely fine .No issues with the product delivery or the working of the system. The only recommendation is to get good skin and keyboard cover as the whole body is a fingerprint magnet and may start getting smudges very fast.
3,I bought this in June and haven't even used more than 2 weeks.keyboard started auto typing.sometimes none of the keys are recognised  .i tried everything from reinstalling drivers to windows update.i had to raise service request with lenovo as none of them worked.within 2 months since I bought this I had to replace the keyboard as hardware was faulty.if something like this happens it's not worth to get the laptop for this price.quality check of the products needs to be done properly before dispatching this to the customer.
5,Best laptop packed with latest technology. Simply go for it.
3,Review after a week of usage:The screen quality is good. 4/5Battery:Heavy usage- 2 hoursNormal official usage with internet - upto 5 hours Lenovo failed to stand on its words by saying it gives backup upto 8 hoursSo overall battery is 1/5.Performance - 4/5Overall 3.5/5 at a cost of 60k for Lenovo i5 11 16gb ram
5,Laptop setup was very smooth. Overall display quality and battary life per charge is excellent. It was shipped with Win11. Wifi connection stability is good. There is no option to use laptop lock and there is no LAN port as well. Overall it's a good buy.
5,Very good laptop. Light weight. Sharp display. Very good battery life and very fast.
5,"Professional, Smart and compact laptop with very good configuration."
4,"Loved it. Sturdy and compact and lightweightScreen display quality is good for day to day office use.Sound quality is pretty good.Only negative is, it does get warmer over the left  side on the keyboard during playing games or charging."
4,Good
5,This laptop is really awesome every thing is great. The only issue that I am facing that laptop and charge is overheating during charging.
4,smooth and compact
1,Facing Screen flickering Problem
5,Very light and compact Laptop.
5,Good laptop
1,"I made mistake of buying this ideapad series last year, I can tell you 1) build quality is very flimsy 2) Hardware is erratic - i don't know why camera and Audio shut of in-between teams call. I have keep restarting to see if this time camera will work3) Support is equally 3rd grade - they will call you when they feel like and have no solution but just install and unistall drivers.All these 5 star ratings are managed, Laptop is really horrible - best avoided.."
1,You should never go for this laptop as it is simply waste of money. If somebody is giving you this laptop for free also please don't take it as it is simply meant for occupying Unnecessary space at your home. Initially I thought of listing out its  cons But list is too big And I don't want to waste my time to review this waste product. From  Day one it started hanging And trust me you can have a nice nap Before it opens welcome screen.
5,"Very good product, liked the size and performance, jus go for it without second thought , boot time is very very speed and simple pass works great"
5,Nice laptop I like it and I am sorry for the delay in getting the samek din ke liyr u
5,Very nice laptop as I had not purchased it from Amazon I had purchased it from reliance store seriously the laptop is a beast in speed
1,"After 10 days , it started continuously hanging. It is not working properly. I wasted money . If u decide to buy then go for HP."
5,Happy with the product. Packaging is good received in 2 days. this is my Initial impression and not a review - Laptop performance is excellent and good battery backup. 250 nits brightness is more than enough for a non photoshop/video editing user.In addition Dell Cinema Color S/W enhances the viewing experience by providing 4 picture profiles.It is having Dual channel 8+8 ram which is a nice thing to have. 512 GB SSD is WD brand. Product looks classy and no unnecessary stickers around touch pad only intel stickers provided. Finger print sensor is responsive.Like the color of the laptop.
4,"The product looks really classy. Already windows 11 update is ready to install. Speakers are loud enough, build quality and otherwise it's good. Display is very bright for indoors, but outdoors might be little less. The laptop is also not light weight but it's sleek, fingerprint integrated in power button is fast and the right way to have it. Track pad is big enough. Update all drivers from dell and windows 11 as it fixes some minor bugs as soon as you get the laptop"
5,"Very good customer service by the seller. Amazing laptop. Speacial thanks to Mr. Vikas from Dell - DCC Infotech Prvt Ltd, Mumbai üôè."
5,Bought for office work. Will take few more weeks to fully use functionalities. So far performance as expected. People looking for midrange laptop can opt for this.
5,"Great , product seems like a Dell version of Apple mac book.Solid package and Great buttonsClarity in video display and Audio are impressiveUser friendly"
5,really nice product and works very well.
1,Never purchase Dell pathetic customer service bad wifi throughput it will never catch wifi in a airport.  Will not recommend.

1,"Screen display is having white spots, called Amazon guys and arranged a technical visit which didnt happen at the selected time slot and the ticket got completed without technician visit.Again raised a complaint, submitted pictures but no avail. Just got another date for technician visit. Too much disappointed with so costly product and Amazon service."
2,It's a good laptop indeed. But I bought it for 75990 and now it has increased its price to 81000.  What is this. It was already overpriced for its specs. Now this. Amazon needs to do something about this.  Now.  i5 11300h. Good one. But 4 cores is a but of a letdown. Rtx3050. Good one. Asus the laptop and softwares they've provided. Very nice. I personally wouldn't recommend this laptop since it's overpriced now.
4,"This is i5 11gen RTX 3050 model which I got for 69k. Every other laptop in this price range generally comes with GTX 1650 hence I decided to try out RTX 3050. Mind that it is 75W powered so you might noy be getting whole out of your GPU power.Looks wise - White color looks just amazing though if you are a tough user then it may stain quickly also build quality is good the front frame is metallic which feels great.Performance- This is where things lacks when you buy a 70k machine you want it to give atleast150-200 FPS in CSGO or any equivalent FPS shooter. But to my surprise it barely managed to give an avg of 100 FPS. Man that low considering this is a 70k laptop.Battery - Battery kinda good considering it is a gaming laptop thanks to iGPU mode and other battery efficient options.Camera- It doesn't have one.Display - Nice display not the greatest one but a decent one.Sound- I just use it with my headphones on, So speakers doesn't matter to me. But if you are someone who use laptop speaker for any work then you might not like the sound.Weight- It's a 2kg machine. That nice considering its a gaming laptop.Final Verdict- If you are looking for a gaming  laptop which also has a professional look to it you may go with it. Performance wise it's good but didn't meet my expectation.Update- I just upgraded to 16gb and now its got a huge performance boost. Initially I was getting 90-100 FPS in Valorant but Now it gives 170-200 FPS."
4,Atleast should have given MS office package or Laptop bag or any accessories.Anyways very good.
5,This is the only laptop which is available in the market for 85k.. Which has rtx 3050..intel i7 11th gen processor and 16 gb ram.I have been using this laptop for over a month and i would say its an absolute gaming beast. I play valorant at 60 fps without any frame drop and the cooling of this laptop is awesome.. Just place it on a stand and it would be much better.I mainly use this device for editing works... So the latest adobe versions can be run smoothly without any problem in this device.The only small problem is the battery life...its give around ony 4 hrs of normal useage.. But this is a problem which comes with every gaming laptop.So overall a great product.
1,And they are not even giving replacement for the same. Though I am a regular buyer from Amazon.
5,"well i must say this beast was more than i expected....i got it in 69990 in Diwali festival offers...but i would say i must recommended ...i checked..so far no issues are there...if you are taking this for gaming...i prefer you to take i7 ...i5 works well though...and the laptop is awesomeüî•üî•üî•...built quality, working and all.....go for it without without a thought...also i thought that this would be a defective piece...but i checked everything...there is nothing wrong...and This si complete budget gaming laptop if you want to buy!!!!!"
5,It has everything that you need starting from you day to day activities to playing AAA games in high graphics! The performance is amazing and it not have any issues in that matter.The screen doesnt have a 100 percent Adobe RGB or sRGB and you wont notice the difference if you arent a video editor. This laptop is meant for gaming and it very well excels at it.I havent faced any thermal throtelling or any other abnormalities. It works really well and would recommend this product.
5,"#asus tuf dash f15yahhh!!! it has a little heating problem but it can be resolved by use a stand or like me by lifting up the back side it can let laptop take more for cooling and then let fans do there thing,as for gaming ahhh!!! seriously i didn't play the games before and I don't know about gaming but on this 'dash' for me gaming gose on another lvl!!!!(i just played only three game Forza Horizon 4, Project Car 2 and dota 2)and for other thing like movies web series anime it's great."
4,"Been using it for around a week and a half now, so far the experience has been good, I've faced no issues or inconveniences and everything seems to work well.Some good things about this laptop are the battery, the 144HZ refresh rate monitor, armoury app and the keys to change fan speeds manually.The GPU in this one seems underwhelming since it's an RTX 3050, even though it performs better and has additional features than the 1650, it still doesn't feel like a massive difference. For me this is a huge upgrade since I was using a pentium laptop and getting around 30-50 fps in most games but now with this I have anywhere from 60 - 250.  So I'm definitely enjoying this. Do not hesitate to buy an RTX 3050 if you have this tight budget, it is certainly future proof since it's a new arrival though I would highly recommend you get your ram upgraded to 16GB as soon as you buy this, it'll help avoid dissapponting fps."

2,It's a good laptop indeed. But I bought it for 75990 and now it has increased its price to 81000.  What is this. It was already overpriced for its specs. Now this. Amazon needs to do something about this.  Now.  i5 11300h. Good one. But 4 cores is a but of a letdown. Rtx3050. Good one. Asus the laptop and softwares they've provided. Very nice. I personally wouldn't recommend this laptop since it's overpriced now.
4,"This is i5 11gen RTX 3050 model which I got for 69k. Every other laptop in this price range generally comes with GTX 1650 hence I decided to try out RTX 3050. Mind that it is 75W powered so you might noy be getting whole out of your GPU power.Looks wise - White color looks just amazing though if you are a tough user then it may stain quickly also build quality is good the front frame is metallic which feels great.Performance- This is where things lacks when you buy a 70k machine you want it to give atleast150-200 FPS in CSGO or any equivalent FPS shooter. But to my surprise it barely managed to give an avg of 100 FPS. Man that low considering this is a 70k laptop.Battery - Battery kinda good considering it is a gaming laptop thanks to iGPU mode and other battery efficient options.Camera- It doesn't have one.Display - Nice display not the greatest one but a decent one.Sound- I just use it with my headphones on, So speakers doesn't matter to me. But if you are someone who use laptop speaker for any work then you might not like the sound.Weight- It's a 2kg machine. That nice considering its a gaming laptop.Final Verdict- If you are looking for a gaming  laptop which also has a professional look to it you may go with it. Performance wise it's good but didn't meet my expectation.Update- I just upgraded to 16gb and now its got a huge performance boost. Initially I was getting 90-100 FPS in Valorant but Now it gives 170-200 FPS."
4,Atleast should have given MS office package or Laptop bag or any accessories.Anyways very good.
5,This is the only laptop which is available in the market for 85k.. Which has rtx 3050..intel i7 11th gen processor and 16 gb ram.I have been using this laptop for over a month and i would say its an absolute gaming beast. I play valorant at 60 fps without any frame drop and the cooling of this laptop is awesome.. Just place it on a stand and it would be much better.I mainly use this device for editing works... So the latest adobe versions can be run smoothly without any problem in this device.The only small problem is the battery life...its give around ony 4 hrs of normal useage.. But this is a problem which comes with every gaming laptop.So overall a great product.
1,And they are not even giving replacement for the same. Though I am a regular buyer from Amazon.
5,"well i must say this beast was more than i expected....i got it in 69990 in Diwali festival offers...but i would say i must recommended ...i checked..so far no issues are there...if you are taking this for gaming...i prefer you to take i7 ...i5 works well though...and the laptop is awesomeüî•üî•üî•...built quality, working and all.....go for it without without a thought...also i thought that this would be a defective piece...but i checked everything...there is nothing wrong...and This si complete budget gaming laptop if you want to buy!!!!!"
5,It has everything that you need starting from you day to day activities to playing AAA games in high graphics! The performance is amazing and it not have any issues in that matter.The screen doesnt have a 100 percent Adobe RGB or sRGB and you wont notice the difference if you arent a video editor. This laptop is meant for gaming and it very well excels at it.I havent faced any thermal throtelling or any other abnormalities. It works really well and would recommend this product.
5,"#asus tuf dash f15yahhh!!! it has a little heating problem but it can be resolved by use a stand or like me by lifting up the back side it can let laptop take more for cooling and then let fans do there thing,as for gaming ahhh!!! seriously i didn't play the games before and I don't know about gaming but on this 'dash' for me gaming gose on another lvl!!!!(i just played only three game Forza Horizon 4, Project Car 2 and dota 2)and for other thing like movies web series anime it's great."
4,"Been using it for around a week and a half now, so far the experience has been good, I've faced no issues or inconveniences and everything seems to work well.Some good things about this laptop are the battery, the 144HZ refresh rate monitor, armoury app and the keys to change fan speeds manually.The GPU in this one seems underwhelming since it's an RTX 3050, even though it performs better and has additional features than the 1650, it still doesn't feel like a massive difference. For me this is a huge upgrade since I was using a pentium laptop and getting around 30-50 fps in most games but now with this I have anywhere from 60 - 250.  So I'm definitely enjoying this. Do not hesitate to buy an RTX 3050 if you have this tight budget, it is certainly future proof since it's a new arrival though I would highly recommend you get your ram upgraded to 16GB as soon as you buy this, it'll help avoid dissapponting fps."
5,using it after 2 weekspros..1.awesome battery life around 7-8hrs2.good screen3.keypad and trackpad is good . I'm liking it.4..speaker is like  ok ok .5. gaming experience was good.  like 110fps in valorant in high setting and 60-75fps in warzone in recommended setting(single 8gb ram).cons.1. no inbuilt camera (but you can use my asus aap to share cam of your phone in laptop)2. no ms office 365
3,"The product arrived on time, setup is fast and easy. Unfortunately, the keyboard of the unit was malfunctioning - it prints ',' when you press '@' and vice versa. Then there are multiple keys misbehaving like that.Now the problem starts: You contact customer service and they ask repeatedly same basic questions as if we are computer illiterate. Once you go through that pain, they will send a series of software to download and test. Now if you had that much patience and after few hours, you upload the images to the link they provide, they agree to accept replacement. Now after 2 days, no return label, you contact CS again.You go through the basic questions again and now you lose patience. Long story short, finally a technician was able to create a return order.Some of the questions asked:""was it in a moist environment""""was it dropped""So, the person should at least understand - the keys will not type wrongly (no chance of a short circuit, if the keys are consistent) if any of the above things happened. It is a defective keyboard and manufacturing defect."
1,"Keyboard keys are different between@ ""More then 5 key's are opposite I'm made a replacement request the again receive with same problem. So don't buy it. Thanks"
5,"Beast of a product. Far cry new dawn and gta 5 runs so smoothly with the rtx 3050 and with that 144hz display.Go for it. Great buy. Unmatchable specs for Rs68,000."
1,"Received defective piece, dont buy any laptop from this seller Apario"
2,"There is a good enough number of people who has ordered this laptop & have been using it, without knowing that it's a different laptop.The laptop you get in the box is a DELL VOSTRO 14/ 3000 WHILE THE LISTING IS OF DELL VOSTRO 14/ 3400.POINTS TO BE NOTED:1. The box & the owners manual that I have received are of 3400 while the laptop itself is a 3000.2. I thought maybe 3400 is a 3000 series laptop however after some research, realised that 3400 is a better laptop.3. 3400 has a USB Type-C & has IRIS XE as compared to the old Integrated UHD.Be very alert while buying laptops online, you never know what you r about to get.I exchanged my laptop & now waiting for refund since past three days. Just a sheer waste of time n effort. DISAPPOINTED"
5,Product is too good .but battery back too low more than 3 hours
4,Clock speed is not as mentioned in the description.There's no high performance mode.Backlit keyboard is goodOverall product is nice .
2,It's been 2 days only. This laptop has heating issues. Within 5 minutes only it started heating. Keypad also started heating. & Battery backup is worst. Like within 10 minutes it's regrading by 15 to 20%
3,"AMAZON IS SELLING DEFECTIVE ITEMS.At the offer time I bought Dell Vostro 3400 14"" laptop. That has some display issue. So I asked for replacement. I received new laptop after 3 days.  There was free Windows 11 upgrade option, During the upgradation time I received Blue screen due to some memory issue.NEED TO RETHINK ABOUT THE QUALITY OF PRODUCT AMAZON IS SELLING."
1,I am unable to keep hand on laptop to type as it has heating issue. I never face such problems in other laptop till yet. Its really uncomfortable to type due to its heating issue
1,Battery backup less then 1 hour. Totally sucks
5,"Its been 2 months usage, haven't seen any negative in it.what i feel is worth my money 59,541 with i5 10th gen processor, 8gb ram, 256gb+1tb HDD, inbuilt IRIS graphics. As other brands not offering extending your RAM, this has 2 dedicated slots for ram (ram can be removed, not soldered) where you can have another 8gb ram as well.Also i see youtubers are promoting worstly now days like laptops can be used by youtubers(for editing), students and gamers. Dont know whey they discuss on narow bezzle, laptops not eating display size from years ago.Dont think with dell will get omlet with that heat. Charge if laptop not in use and dont use lap for movies and games when in charge. so that you may get better battery backup also.Finally i can say its best buy, rich look, sounds good, performance good, display is good, Cam is ok as expected and as required.regarding price, during duserra this price is 62,XXX/- with offers you can get for 60k. what's the point in  doing business. all i understood is Business = Lie."
3,OVERALL GOD BUT TYPE C IS NOT AVAILABE WHICH IS SHOWN IN PICTURE
5,I purchased it for my son. He is satisfied.
5,"Got the laptop at a fairly good deal and for the moment, it's a great laptop. The build quality is great and something that we've come to love and appreciate from Dell. Comes with an i5 11th gen processor so it's very prompt. Battery backup is good. 64 bit with 8GB ram and 1TB storage. It's a non touch screen display. Very good value for money."
5,Good battery life lasts upto 6 hours. And also it's light weight. Packaging was very good. Also having Backlit.
4,"The laptop is overall great. At first the laptop had freezing issue, either during booting or after lock screen it used to freeze 6/10 times. Then tried a few tricks -1. Manually update the BIOS.2. Reduce the startup services to only the required ones using msconfig.3. Turn off windows drive encryption (OS drive).After doing these changes, the laptop started running smoothly. Added another 8gb ddr4 ram to top it off.For me these changes worked, if someone is facing the same issues, then can try these steps."
1,In the order it was mentioned that Microsoft office will be provided. But i found that it is only for 1 month and after that i require activation code which apparently has not been provided.Also laptop gets heated within 5 minutes of working. I guess i3 is better.
1,"Product claims to be having a Backit, but NO, it is NOT AVAILABLE.  HEATING ISSUE.RETURN ISSUES WITH AMAZON as well. Think 10 times before buying"
3,No optical drive as mentioned here
4,"Dell inspiron 3501,as it is good model in 2021 one can choose it.But the issue is battery durability is only 3 hrs and all is well"
5,"After 2 months of use, its good budget laptop. Overall everything is good .. battery backup is also good ..fast boot is one of the good feature"
2,Laptop fan makes very noise when it starts...why it is making so much noise...loud fan noise..very irritating
5,"Have been using since a week. Nice product. Using for programming,  excellent performance"

5,"Product is really nice, worth for money."
5,Excellent laptop.... looking very classy look
1,Battery drain and power on issue
3,The battery gets drained very fast if use any other video-enabled app. Doesn't even lasts for 3 hrs.
2,I'm unable to use Microsoft office in general. It disabled all the features and now I can't edit assignment or make a new one in this laptop.
3,"Pls consider all things before buyingpros:1.Fast booting due to ssd and  I5 processor2.

5,Good product
5,Good
3,Pros1. Good performance at this price range.2. Ram is upgradable to 12gbCons1. Very cheap display quality.2. You need a n anti glare glasses to work with this display.3. Build quality is cheap.4. You will feel pain in eyes after doing few hours of coding.
5,"gud product.. recommendedlight weight, good quality display and keyboard.. decent look..lenovo is a durable product..i am using LENOVO G580 since 2012, it is still working fine.."
5,"Looks- Dual tones of grey in matt aluminium finish looks suave and stylish. Would look equally good in a conference room as well as in a living room.Built- All metal chassis gives a feel of holding something sturdy and well built. MIL standard durability gives a little assurance against bumps and falls. Noticeably heavier than ultralight notebooks (Asus Zenbook/HP Pavilion Aero/LG Gram) but comparable with other convertibles (Yoga 6/HP Envy/Dell Inspiron 7415).Display- Glossy screen to support touchscreen and stylus functionality. Could get a little difficult to view under direct sunlight but I am not complaining much since there's always an option to switch modes (tent/tablet) to suit viewing angles.Performance- Boots really fast within 5 seconds. Fingerprint scanner is snappy. Multiple Internet browser tabs, MS Excel and Word sheets, VDI, mainframe applications are handled with ease that too in Battery Saver mode. Additional Ram slot would come in handy for Memory upgrade which is a big thumbs up.Ports and Connectivity - Two type-C USB slots, one being Thunderbolt 4 ready. Future proof.Battery- Easily lasts 7-8 hours of moderate usage with brightness set at 40-50% on Battery Saver mode. Dockable Stylus lasts about half an hour but I think it could do more.Software and Warranty - Comes with 3 years Premier Onsite support. Mine had a warranty start date a few months prior to purchase date. There was an option to modify the purchase date and warranty was updated accordingly. Microsoft Office 2019 lifetime validity.Conclusion- This was a steal deal at 68k offering incredible office productivity and flexiblilty of a convertible. Ugradable Ram/SSD slots, Thunderbolt 4, 3 years warranty makes it an absolute winner!"
5,Upgraded the RAM to 16 GB as one slot is empty.Performance: 4/5. Would have been better if ryzen 5600u was present instead of Intel.Screen: 4.5/5. No bleeding issues. Contrast and colors are good. It is a glossy screen so -.5 starsBuilt Quality: 5/5. Not comparable to think book but it is good. This is gen2 laptop which has the mil rating. Gen3 has no such rating for some reason but it comes with ryzen chip. Laptop is on the heavier side compared to thinkpads but can't complain at this price point.Ports 5/5. Best feature IMO. It has a thunderbolt port which is missing from Gen3. So you can use a thunderbolt dock or attach an e GPUSpeakers: 3/5. Loud enough but no bass.Touch/Pen/Convertible: Pen has good latency. I didn't see any lag. Touch is accurate. Hinges are sturdy but only time will tell how long it will last.Keyboard: 4/5. Good enough but not comparable to thinkpads.There are certain compromises but overall I am very happy. It ticks most of the boxes.
5,Excellent
5,"You will get lot other options in this budget, But Nothing beats this in buid and features. Got for 70KThe screen is awesome.I was different options in my my mindDell 7415 - Screen isn't very bright, no auto-rotateYoga 6 - Too small 13'3 for office workLenovo FLex 5 - No USB C Display outputHP Pavilion/Envy x360 - Again too small/ DOn't trust HP build qualityThis laptop put alltogether in one. Excellent screen, premium build with metal chassis, light weight, best battery,expandable ram/storage, Good hindge quality, Touch is extemely sensitive and good response.And the  best feature is Stylus goes into laptop, Also 3 years premium onsite warranty which is awesome.Go for it..Don't trust Amazon negative reviewsOnly used 1 day..will update more after usage"
1,"Don‚Äôt buy it online; configuration is good but it has manufacturing defect.In such case, both amazon and lenovo, don't support you well.The manufacturing fit and finish is 19-20 Chalta hai types‚Ä¶you will be able to see fit n finish issues by zooming in the bottom panel pic at corners..and although the laptop offers a good value for money for its price‚Ä¶ the appearance is not wow, it is not same as studio pictures shown in by seller‚Ä¶The top aluminium surface feels like same as utensil in house, it doesn‚Äôt feel sandblasted..Hinge mechanism seems durable‚Ä¶Battery life is moderate, speakers are clear but extremely low bass.. mic is really good..Trackpad click feels too thirdclass and creates huge gap when pressed, the cost cutting is evident there..Typing experience is very bad‚Ä¶ the inbuilt touch pen is too fragile‚Ä¶. This laptop is heavy to use as a touchscreen tablet..The only best thing in this is a screen quality‚Ä¶Lenovo premier support is thirdclass‚Ä¶ they even don‚Äôt talk well‚Ä¶ in case of warranty replacement issues, they wash away hands by issuing DOA certificate which is of no use‚Ä¶And their ground support team is extremely unprofessional‚Ä¶ be aware‚Ä¶"
3,"Update:I don't know what's wrong with my below comment for Amazon to remove it. Not just comment, who are all given rating 3 and below has been removed. I am really feel agigated by the way negative comments are removed.I am asking to amazon, is it fair to remove poor ratings and keep only higher ratings? Is this not a way of fooling people?There is lot to say good about it. Primarily if you analyze thin laptop segment with powerful processor and a graphic card you might have spend near to lak. But this one is near half the price in that section. We definelty have to appreciate what MI brought to the market and other brands charging heavily. What they just did for mobiles ( like bringing 30k  market price worth of mobile to 10k range without compromising the quality) . They did it for laptop as well. GOOD JOB  xiomi.Performance : As for as thin and light laptop segment this is new benchmark they set for others to follow. You don't see lag at all. So far so good. But need to update this section once after a month of use.Portability: sometimes I feel the charger provided is same weight as laptop. I feel like a mobile phone on hand when I am holding itBut, there is lot ot say bad about it as well.Input devicesTrackpad : very pathetic.when u touch it you feel like u touched a unfinished cement surface. It sticks and very hard to navigate around. Highly recommended to buy a seperate mouse to get better experience on this laptop.Keyboard : though it looks good. It not smooth and feels more plastic. Need to be improvisedNo inbuild camera: during the wfh days absence of camera is a huge drawback but there is webcam you need to buy separetely and use it as external deviceCharger and display: there is nothing new to excite about except for less bezel. The design is same as like 10 years old laptop.Overall design: though looks premium feels cheap.. But this is justifiable for the price we payOverall User experience: great on performance. But has to improved in many other aspects like input devices , material qualityOverall review : I recommend to buy if you don't think much about feel and want only make full utilization on processing and performance. Otherwise if you expect something premiuim feel this is not for you."
1,i bought this laptop it gt delivered yesterday. actually i gt a seal broken product and it is also a used laptop by some one . i gt the laptop by luck as I7 varient is always out of stock . nd if i boot up fr d first tym it is asking for a password nd laptop is used by someone name dilpreet kaur and asking fr password or passcode . and it gets blue screen stating pc ran into a problem always when i turn on . i dn kn whether i bought a brand new product frm amazon or a used product from amazon . amazon is not either giving a refund or replacement imediately they r keep on delaying. i m nt saying i nt to buy dis . bt d fault is all on d seller only. soo consider d customer . i hope amazon ll help me fr a replacement or a refund.
5,"I love this laptop for it's awesome.Pros:-1. Great screen quality (it's a matte finish)2. Brilliant Build quality (it's an aluminium unibody construction)3. Smallest footprint for a 14"" screen (has almost no bezels)Cons:-1. RAM is just 8 GB. (Although I didn't face any issues yet)2. Keys on the keyboard don't offer any resistance. (almost feels like the keys will get pressed even if a feather falls on them)3. Trackpad quality is inferior. (Although I don't care since I use an external mouse anyway)"
5,"Before purchase, I went through several reviews of MI Horizon 14"" notebook.  Some of them mentioned about the lack of an in-built camera, the notebook getting hot during gaming & the processor's thermal throttling kicking in, its RAM being not upgradable, its touch-pad being little mushy to operate, lack of a back-lit keyboard etc.  I also noticed that even the rating system of Amazon India requires the customers to rate a notebook based on the quality of the in-built camera, and as to whether the notebook could be used for gaming.  But then, I had my reasons when I went ahead, and bought the Core i7 version of the MI Horizon 14"" notebook.I believe that while buying a notebook, one has to be clear about the purpose.  Style comes close second as a priority.My use for the notebook is for office document creation.  Moreover, I am a touch-typist who doesn't need to look at the keyboard while typing.  In addition, a back-lit keyboard would be a drain on the notebook battery.  So, a back-lit keyboard was not a priority for me.Secondly, I am not a gamer, and even if I were, I would deploy a proper gaming rig for the purpose, and certainly not a 14"" portable notebook.  So considerations of gaming did not affect my notebook purchase.I prefer using a Logitech Full HD webcam for video-conferencing, as it has been my observation that webcams built into the notebooks usually have poor optical performance. Built-in webcam can also be a security risk sometimes.  Xiaomi 's own survey had shown that a webcam is not a priority for most notebook users, but this was before the COVID-19 pandemic (You see, the Chinese did not see the pandemic coming! üòú).As to the RAM being soldered on to the motherboard, many brands are doing this to reduce the thickness of the notebook.  Providing RAM connectors on the motherboard not only adds to the thickness of the notebook, but also adds potential failure points. Removing RAM connectors from the motherboard and directly soldering the RAM on to the motherboard shaves off some cost that could be deployed elsewhere during notebook design.  Besides, 8 GB of RAM is abundant for my requirement, and when the need for upgrade comes, it will be of the notebook and not of the RAM.  Therefore, soldered RAM was not my concern!The design emphasis in MI Horizon 14"" notebook is on minimalism.  This was to my liking.  There is no MI logo anywhere, but at the bottom of the bezel below the screen.  There aren't a plethora of blinking LED lights as one would notice in some Fujitsu notebooks. Only a single tiny green LED indicator exists near the power connector socket. The bezels of the screen are super-slim, and the notebook's lid can be opened with a single finger.The TouchPad is also minimalistic.  The left and right mouse buttons aren't demarcated on the surface of the TouchPad, which assumes the shape of a single rectangular area below the keyboard.  You press the right bottom corner of the TouchPad, you hear the click of the right mouse button, and vice-versa! The keyboard is neatly laid out, and is very comfortable to touch type at full speed.Coming to the screen, the display is indeed an eye-candy.  It is far above in quality compared to several other notebooks which boast of a Full HD screen.  I wouldn't go so far as to rate the screen high in terms of colour accuracy or Adobe RGB compliance.  I would only say that I could effortlessly edit the RAW imagery from my Sony Alpha camera, thanks to the bright display.Overall, a stylish all rounder notebook, provided you are aligned with its design philosophy!"
5,"First of all I assure you that you'll be very happy with this laptop.Keyboard is awesomeWhole system is fastFast turn on and offScreen is really good, can viewed from all angles clearlyFan doesn't turn on until heavy apps/sofrware/games usedNo heating problemBattery is goodBudget is good igSmall and compactOne finger openProblems:Sound is less but it's managableNo fingerprint readerNo microsoft 365 permanent planTrack pad could be little better but okIt's a must buy for this price segment.When it comes to laptop it's not about brand anymore, it's more about specifications."
5,Good design build quality super Mi laptop supports direct casting also need to choose Nvidia graphics  by default graphics set to UHD graphics and also need to set custom audio sounds For better audio output choose user and then enable all Encahces modes along with traditional mode settingsCons :1.No backlight2.Ram expand not possible as soldered to mother board3.touch pad is slight need to improve4.No HDD slot and only 2gb graphic card5.Speakers are located bottom if it was on top  it might good
5,"in notebook horizon  I love the sturdy aluminum unibody chassis. Weighing at just 1.35 kg, the notebook is slim and extremely light. It‚Äôs thin, too. I am also glad to see that despite its size and weight, the notebook has plenty of ports including a Type-C port for data transfer and charging, an HDMI 1.4 port, two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and a headphone jack.but there is missing from the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is a microSD card slot and Thunderbolt 3 supportDidplay is also too good..in speaker there is no too much voice but good not bestkeyboard is good for me but if u need backlight , backlight is not therei love the performance of laptop just take few sec to openit's barvo..and the weight of laptops extremely lightthat's why i also like it..for me there is only one problem that is speaker. i need high voice but that is not there."
5,The laptop is enveloped in a metal body which may give an impression that the Mi Notebook is bulky - but the laptop weighs just 1.3 kilograms which makes it very portable. The laptop feels light and does not have any branding on the top surface. The weight balance is such that you can open the lid with just one finger. Over all experience is awesome
1,"I and my friend decided to buy Xiaomi laptop, We both are having issues with the laptop‚úì Low-quality Components, Heating issue, Suddenly Touchpad Stops Working, Keyboard Stuck while working‚úì Sound of my iPhone XR is more than this laptop ( CHEAP SPEAKER IN LAPTOP)‚úì battery backup is just 4 hours but Xiaomi claim 10 hours of battery, my 5 years old MacBook air has a better battery backup‚úì keyboard feels itself  like cheap quality keys‚úì laptop comes with old age charger ( never seen in notebooks )I don't feel there is anything special to pay a huge amount of 60,000I'm unable to do work on this laptop because of many issuesI lost my money, I'm thinking to sell it out and buy new ASUS laptop"
1,"1. Its display size is too small and dull. Sound quality is also too average.2.  It doesn't have a backlit keyboard. Now even 30 K value laptop has that feature3.  A separate camera feels really awkward. A few mm increase in the bezel size doesn't hurt.4. No option for a ram upgrade. 8 GB won't be enough5. It looks like under 15 k value laptop and feels like built from plastic, not metal.6. No extended warranty option, as purchased from amazon.7. You can only replace, can't return it, bad policy.The Processor and batter don't justify the 60 K value. So Instead of that, I would recommend HP Omen series."
5,Very classy product after 25 days use I didn't find any issues davinci resolve and Adobe premiere runs smoothly. I didn't play heavy games but euro truck gameplay is good. Very light weight easy to handle.Battery give almost 9 hrs standby in video streaming. By using heavier softwares battery drained in 5-6hrs. Overall the product is very good in this price range. I7 10 gen processor is rocking ü§òüèªü§òüèªüî•
4,"Good budget laptop, no issues so far, suggest you buy camera different brand as the camera provided is very bad quality. Overall battery and performance is good.If you are expecting free windows office, better go for lenovo as the version provided is trail and last only 1 month.Keyboard is okay not perfect.You will be boltware softwares which are pre loaded .Buy this laptop with little expectations and keep in mind this is budget laptop."
5,"Reviewing it after 12 days of usage. Trust me amazing product at this price. I would say best product in 14inch screen size. Please go for it if you want an unbelievable performing laptop.I am playing Far Cry 5 it is running as smoothly as in those giant gaming laptops by Asus, Dell.Just one thing the volume is really low. But what could you expect more in this price. They are giving you latest graphic card latest processor and what else. Use earphone while playing games.Coming to battery, so if you are not gaming then it is amazingly high performing battery. Almost 8 hours I used with all browsing coding etc etc and still 12% is remaining there. But if you are gaming then better plug your charger. Because it drains the battery quickly during gaming. And obviously it will drain, it is only a 14 inch laptop and having very small space and one fan which runs high during gaming so battery drains in high rate.Will update more after 1 month.Update after 7 months. Very much satisfied with this laptop. Really amazing battery life and I almost never close my laptop just make it in log off mode. Go for this little monster.Update after 1 year and 3 months of usgae -Superb performance till now. Only the battery performance went down a bit. I observed it's giving 6 to 7 hours max if you are browsing, YouTubeing or any other coding related stuff or reading pdfs. When it was new it used to give almost 8.30 hour to 8 hour of battery performance. But trust me elsewhere the performance is intact. So much satisfied with the device."
5,"This laptop deserves all the Five Stars.The Spec that MI has offered is Amazing while keeping the price almost half to their rivals for Lappy with similar specs.It seems to be silly that the list of cons posted by others like no inbuilt camera, trackpad and keyboard. Nowhere MI has claimed that they have a backlight on the keyboard & there is a camera in built. The trackpad is good and has a matt finish. It is clear to the buyer before placing the order, but there is no point in mentioning these as Cons of the laptop. The built quality is decent and the laptop looks premium. You pay only half and the quality of the used material will obviously in line with what you paid.The reading and writing speeds are best, thanks to the 512 GB NVMe SSD. 8GB RAM is decent enough for a programmer and mild user. Nvidia MX350 2GB GDDR5 Graphics card found to be good for moderate to light heavy games.  As the laptop is light and thin, the battery backup (5 to 6 hours is what I get for moderate use)  is a little less than the rivals offerings. It's a budget MacBook and please go for it without a second thought."
5,"I bought i7 horizon edition.I used roughly for 5 days for surity of its performance with confidence of replace, but its glad to look that it doesn't have any single issue..Track pad is not very much good.I bought it for programming and its working well. Also its doing great for editing.Except its made in China, I didn't found any issue.Also some people complain about heating but believe me it doesn't heating during my work.Ya might be possible during hard gaming it might get heated.Its battery backup is about 7 to 8 hrs of internet uses for my use.My recommendation is that those who need a laptop for working as a student or employee they should definitely go for it with the price of 60k.Otherwise there is many other options ."
2,"Guys please buy this only if you can work on only day time. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs I‚Äôd product manager for this product and they call more power to productivity ...ha haAnyways1. Display is good2. Battery back is good 5+ hrWhy not to buy .1. You can‚Äôt work in night no backlight for keyboard and this is productivity laptop ha ha .2. Audio is average.3. notebook build quality expected good.4. Camera quality is avg.5. No card reader port and fingerprint.6. After using 10 days, Speed/performance is  Poor with android studio.Performance wise worth of money and productivity wise you can look for other models.Mi failed in giving productivity laptop which claims horizon is build for great Productivity."
5,"Excellent notebook, no second question on that front. However, there are some caveats.1) Although madeup of metal, feels fragile.2) Vents are so big on the bottom, we can see circuits, that means ex: water can get in on accidental skills. Be very very careful.3) speakers are bottom firing, almost non existent on trying to watch movies, you need external speakers.4) Web cam is not internal.5) you can never upgrade RAM.6) No backlight key board... Come on.. Living in 90's ?"
2,"I bought the product, seeing what the company claims upto 10 hours back up .. and its only giving 6 to 6.5  hours in full charge and how can they claim upto 10 hours ... Either the product I recieved is faulty or the company is lying literally.. so guys watch out before you buy the product... volume is very low.. up switch on a fan you can hear anything ."
2,Screen hang just one hour after use...build quality is good but their is a lag in laptop...I have read some positive and negative reviews before buying but i ignore the negative review that is my biggest mistake....Please don't waste your money...I am going to return it if same problem persist...Hanging problem is there...Processor is good only on papers...Bad experience.üò£üò£
1,There is a lot of technical issues with the product. After one month of usage the laptop is giving notifications that the Windows license has expired.The keyboard of the laptop and the key travel is a mess. It‚Äôs in the middle of the apple an HP keyboard. It‚Äôs not good for the long usage typing experience.The product feels like cheap plastic and since there is no branding it makes the product look even more generic.
1,"Dear All, After using it for 6 Days from the date of delivery I am writing this Review. While using the Mi Notebook, Burning Smell is Always Coming with too much of Heat. I suggest not to Buy This Mi Notebook."
4,The first thing you would love is its compact form. The first thing you would hate is its flimsy trackpad.Display is good. Brighness is fine. I dislike that SSD it is pre-partitioned. Should have left it my way.Mi Blaze unlock is fine and so is regular work with productivity apps.Not having backlit is a bad move. Keyboard experience is good. Volumes are at best average !Good for a budget
1,"It was delivered on 21st June and just after 6 days of delivery, it stopped working suddenly and is hot like hell. These Chinese companies are nothing more than thugs."
4,"Have to sacrifice a few things like system volume, inbuilt camera, small screen etc., for the i7 processor in this price range. System volume is too low, not suitable for music lovers. No inbuilt camera. Overall a good product in this price range, with slim look and less weight."
5,"Oh God I can't explain Speed of my Mi 14 Horizen , what'a speed . This is a powerful machine in this range. With i7 . I love its app opening speed. And with in  2 seconds it start and it takes max 2.5 sec to reboot . Woow speed .woow2. Charging And BatteryIt charges Full with in 50 min. It charges faster than my mobile Phone .No heating while charging.Don't think about its battery life you don't need to look at its battery in whole day . You sit on laptop on 9 am don't need charging till 10pm. Many times I work on crome I use it 18-20 hours in single charging. Isn't amazing3. Looks What a fully metalic body looks like mac . Very slim and very little bazales.thin bazals less than your phone.4. Touch pad woow touchpad very smooth and large .Don't think you should buy or not.... Don't leave this window just order it ."
1,i bought this product thinking that it has a i7 10th Gen processor but seems like it is useless as other hardware is pathetic.I try to load a game and it restarting every time when I try to run the game.after some time use its mouse pad stopped working.Really a big disappointment
4,Combine macbook pro & dell XPS 13 and voila you got your self a mi notebook 14 horizon.Although I didn't received webcam bundled in box probably got dropped while shipping raised concern about it they didn't provided me another thats why giving it 4 stars other wise everything is great listed down some pros & consPros :1.Light weight smaller form factor2.Premium look & fill3.Powerful enough to to handle day to day task4.Doesn't heat up5.Bezzel less display looks great6.Charging speed is fast with bundled chargerCons :1.No backlight keyboard2.No room for upgradation eccept SSD3.Display brightness fills lacking while watching content
1,"I bought this product just 10 days back and sparingly used.  And there is a problem with display - having vertical and horizontal lines on the screen.Just 2 days after the return policy, the problem started.  Amazon is not ready to take back the productDont think I will come back to Amazon or buy any MI Products from now on.Very typical of a Chinese company.  Seriousyly disappointed"
1,"Never expected such a low quality product from Amazon & Lenovo. Laptop not booting as soon as it arrived. Now lenovo support team says they need invoice with serial number. Amazon guys says i can't return/replace with out technician visit. Earliest appointment is after 4 days. Losing 4 days for technician to come and check above screen is meaning less. Totally disappointing experience with lenovo, this seller & amazon"

5,This laptop too good for every work on daily basis. Legging free experience. Much faster than 10th gen laptop. No issue found in any side of this laptop.
5,"I have been using this laptop for over 5 months now. The start up time is truly amazing, lesser than 5 seconds. Battery life is about 6 hours on regular usage. I do work from home so it's on continuously for 8 to 10 hours. Performance has not degraded despite heavy usage. Happy with the purchase"
5,"Great laptop at this price. Amazing battery life.Sound and display are good too.The only issue I've faced a couple of times is ,the screen suddenly goes black while I'm doing some work and the work cannot be restored, i have to manually restart the system,there's no way around it. That and the fact that certain applications seem to hang alot ,which have worked fine in the other laptops I've used.Other than these things, the laptop is amazing. Recommend buying."

1,"We are running a startup in Bangalore where perhaps our biggest mistake has been buying LENOVO laptops for our employees. Many of these have given us nightmares with frequent breakdowns. But the most shocking part is that LENOVO treats the customers like garbage. We have also discovered defects in newly opened pieces and even in those cases, the company refused to replace the machines. They are absolutely ATROCIOUS when it comes to customer care ‚Äî both in terms of attitude and support.Our recommendation: AVOID !!"
5,"If u r planning for buying laptop for study purpose then this is the best one. 15.6 inch display, backlit keyboard with numeric keypad, finger print sensor etc. üòçüòçBattery runs approx 3 hr after full charge..It takes 2 hr for full chargingüîã‚ö°.

4,"Likes/Pros1. Screen quality is good could have been little better,especially a brightness2. Performance,booting time is awesome,tried to open 230mb excel sheet,took less than 3 minutes whereas other laptops used to take 10minutes to open it up.3. Data transfer speed is really amazing.Its 10x faster than usual laptops,kudos to SSD4. Youtube works flawless with minimal or no buffering time.Dislikes/Cons1. Lenovo should have offered a fingerprint scanner at this price range."
3,"Having worked on high end UHD laptops, this looks like bummer. I could see the horizontal lines in the display with naked eyes. Although works perfectly for Kids laptop, but I expected higher resolution screen. Anyways, it works charm with SSD and 8 GB RAM."
5,"I bought this for my friend. I already had a same config HP 15 Laptop of same price. But due to Hp's poor build, I thought of buying this and I was 100% right to make this decision. This is really a value for money product. All the specifications are as per description, has lightling boot speed. I am not going to detail only the pros, cons or specs. Rather I would leave a comparison below with other same config model.1. When I bought this, this was the lowest price brand, other brands were listed at higher price. But on a good day, you will find other brands to be at matching price with this. So, I won,t say it's cheap, but it's the correct price.2. It's build is way better than Hp.3. It offers you backlight keyboard.4. Providing 2 years of warranty by default5. Ms office fully activated :)I would really suggest this to keep in your picklist if you are about buy similar config model."
1,"Within 25 days the Mic conked. This is the third week after lodging complaint. Till date laptop is not rectified. They sent wrong part and wasted one week. Now they are replacing the motherboard for which I have been waiting since 4 days.  Their engineer was pathetic. Doesn't know English. And was going to replace USB board while the problem is with the mic! Deeply disappointed with Lenovo customer service, technical team,  team leaders and engineers."
5,Value for money good battery backup and overall value for money. Best for casual student use. Bit less no of USB type 3 ports. It has only 2. wireless mouse will take one.
1,"I had purchased this around 2-3 months back, within 10 days I realised there was one sticky key in the keyboard. On service request keyboard was replaced but after that touchpad stopped working, within first month 3-4 times my laptop was operated for different issues, now it's already 3 months and still touchpad is not working.Rest of the things are working fine but when you buy something expensive and had to call customer service within a month for multiple issues that means quality check is not being performed."
5,"I Had bought an HP 15 (2021) Intel 11th Gen Core i5 15.6 inches  for my son and this for myself . Though the HP was a bit more expensive , I can say for sure that the Lenovo built is premium keeping everything same. The quality of finish , the keyboards, the screen is absolutely brilliant. Got this for 40k post exchange and offers...and I think its worth the money , where as I don't feel the same about the HP. Anyone looking at an 15, 512 SSD, 15.6 inch should keep this laptop in consideration set"
1,"I bought this laptop a week back, considering its specs and price it was a good value for money product but when I operated it I was shocked with display quality as it was a whitish and highly colour inaccurate display and for sure it wasn't IPS display because when u tilt it slightly the display becomes either whitish or high contrast with colour change, rest of the specs are good. Somehow seller changed its display quality, on the company website it is mentioned that it will have IPS display."
5,"No lags and smoother experience. If you want i5 experience within limited budget, this is the best. Initially I was having wireless connectivity issues which lenovo responded with quality service. If you have to buy ethernet to usb adapter if you are opting for wiredlan connection. Lastly, till date, I am very much overwhelmed and satisfied with the performance."
3,I bought it and thought it has an led display but display is led backlight means the panel is still lcd. Display is poor rest everything is very good. Also there is one type c port which can only be used to transfer data we can not use it for adding additional display it not a thunderbolt port. Performance is very good no lag while using vscode 15-20 chrome tabs played gta 5 at 1080 performance was very good. It comes with 2 year warranty which is good build quality is good but not great it could be better. All body is plastic. It comes with name m.2 SSD so it is fast. Also ports are not latest and wifi 5 is provided not 6
5,Product is good.But little expensive. With this price laptop bag and mouse should be given.So in total it is 2k expensive with compared to physical dealer buying.

5,"Got this delivered today, this laptop is a beautiful looking product. Arctic Grey colour is really impressive. Boot up speed is lightning fast. I use for it mainly for work calls. There is an absolutely amazing feature on this product by which you can enable noise cancellation during your work calls. My team does not have to hear my dog bark anymore. Performance is top notch and battery life is decent around 4-5 hours. Overall, very happy with the purchase."
2,"It is a nice product, only to listen online class and it is to heavy price because the company not providing ssd and ethernet port to laptop, it is only use for general purposes for performing heavy task the processor was running slow and some laptops are getting with manufacturer defect due to the hard disk was obtained 100% occupancy while perform single task"

1,Not happy with Lenevo
4,"#WHO CAN USE IT: Programmers, Word, excel, movies, low end gaming like call of duty, far cry 3, occasional video editing with premier pro, Online classes and zoom meetings. All these things will just work flawlessly and you can even multi task to a great extent. You can also go for this cheaper HP laptop  amazon.in/gp/product/B08XNYN5QV  . Its also i5.#Things I like:- Lightweight design. Looks thin- IPS FULL HD display- 8 GB DDR4 RAM- i5 11th gen, the latest one- SSD 512GB, which is a must- Windows 10 with MS Office Pre installed-FingerPrint-Backlit keyboard- Performance is good, boots in 5-10 sec, shutdowns in 3-5 sec- Average battery backup for moderate users (4-5hours)#Things to note:- Built quality is not metal, it's plastic and feels a bit cheap- 720p web cam is okeshI hope it helps.-Aj"
5,"Got this delivered today, this laptop is a beautiful looking product. Arctic Grey colour is really impressive. Boot up speed is lightning fast. I use for it mainly for work calls. There is an absolutely amazing feature on this product by which you can enable noise cancellation during your work calls. My team does not have to hear my dog bark anymore. Performance is top notch and battery life is decent around 4-5 hours. Overall, very happy with the purchase."
2,"It is a nice product, only to listen online class and it is to heavy price because the company not providing ssd and ethernet port to laptop, it is only use for general purposes for performing heavy task the processor was running slow and some laptops are getting with manufacturer defect due to the hard disk was obtained 100% occupancy while perform single task"
5,It's A very Nice nd perfect laptop in this price md it's also far better than old IdeaPad series laptops
3,"I HAVE SEEN PURCHAGE TIME IN AMAZON SIGHT FINGER PRINT READER ALSO BUILT IN, BUT RECIEVED ITEM NO FINGERPRINT READER"
1,Purane zamane k phone jaisa hai jisme battery seperate hai or sim card bhi ek nano lgta hai to ek micro. Camera quality bekar hai kyuki photos m to brightness aa jati hai pr video bilkul dark  bnti hai.  Iski flash light se zyada to candle üïØ ki roshni hoti hai. Slow processing hai.  In sb qualities ke saath iska price(4999/-) kuch zyada hi hai.
3,Camera bad
1,Both the slots couldnot detect sim.
5,Nice condition after use 12 months .i recommend this mobile for smartuse.charging capacity also nice . don't waste time to see other mobiles.
5,the phone is quite beautiful. I love this color. Amazing experience and good budget phone. Love to recommend this phone.

1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
3,Made in China product
1,1. Very bad quality mobile2. Poor display quality(looks very cheap)3. Sound is very low4. Cmaera is like 2mp camera5. Performance is very slow(lag while using phone)6. Will get better mobiles with this price.7. Think 100 times before wasting your money on crap8. No pros at all
3,No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
4,Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
3,"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
3,"Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."

If you can squeeze in a few more bucks, then there are many good phone for 9k."
5,Wow
4,"This phone is only good for parents who are using whatsapp, facebook, youtube, calling, etc...*Camera is average. You get average photos on day time.*Ram management is very bad. You can only run upto 2apps simultaneously üòî*go for only 3gb ram variant.*miui is good but some glitch some time.*do not expect huge gaming(maximum temple run level games)*in the lock scrern glance for mi is irritating.*battery is the plus point. For parents it last upto 1 weak. (Minimum use)*display is good.*front cam is also good. Good clariry while video calling.*no fast charging.*single speaker performs well.My personal suggession I bought it for me first but its not suitable me so i gave it to my father üòÇhe is very happy with itüòä"
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"

2,"It's an average phone. Quite on the pretty side. ONLY those who are looking for a budget phone can think of purchasing this one. The camera is very average, but the functions & controls of the phone are smooth. It's very lightweight - that's a plus!"
5,Its a really very amazing and a nicely working phone..the camera quality and battery is also very goodü§©üòä.liked the product very much
1,Worst mobile . I never expect from oppo such a low grade mobile. Touch is not working. Phone hanging. No return and replacement option.  From Amazon I got bad experience. Don't buy this mobile. Waste of money.
1,It is roadside product with dusty display. When called Amazon customer care she deny to replace item. Don't buy anything from Amazon. Amazon only sells defective items. I returned many items and this was very useless response. She also disconnected call.USELESS AMAZON
1,"when i ordered this phone , headphone is free with phone but received order without headphone"
4,Nice phone value for money but in inbox there is no earphone and screen protector receive being a regular customer of Amazon i am  unhappy there was  clearly written that these items are included in inbox.
1,"Body sensor not working. Was late by 2 days to find out this defect and so could not use ""return"" option.Due to body sensor problem, phone display never gets off while talking and so when brought close to ear, buttons like mute, hold gets activated while speaking.The basic function, which is to talk to others on phone becomes troublesome. Everytime have to very careful of holding position to make sure phone is not touched on body. Hate this and feel cheated/dejected.Cannot return as well."
3,i have recently bought this phone..on 18 may 2020.. delivery is good but there was no headphones in a box.features r awesome nd phone is working gud.but camera quality is bit bad.
1,This mobile was used by someone else.I have got someone else's mobile.I am not happy for this mobile.I will not do return this mobile.Because the reason of I give gift for other person.
5,"Nice mobile prices 12,450"
5,"Oppo always exports premium quality mobiles. Let there be no such features like other mobile but i phone also doesn't export such features at high price, then?I have attached some pictures also you can check them incase you wanna see the picture quality.Hence you can buy this without any tension.Amazing mobile's camera and body quality and display is also good.Go for it I suggest. üòÉ"
1,Don't buy it from Amazon the return service of Amazon is very bad..disgusting they never think customer problem no one in call centre never call you return policy and service is very poor only benefit looking cite ... don't buy anything from amazon.. in future I never buy electronics items from Amazon... flipcart is most trusted than amazon
1,This product received wrost.. In this item some useful applications not run..Order canceled but no cancelation status and pick up status updating by Amazon..No any contact provided by Amazon..Realy disappoint..
4,"Better to value for money , quality is as per shown ..And fast delivered by amazon."
1,Earphones not received in a phone box
1,The phone lags a lot right from the box. You have to swipe 3-4 times. Apps get hung. Never seen such a pathetic phone.
1,"1. Phone don't have type C charging2. Dual app not possible for all app like redmi phones3. Charger is normal 5v 2 Amp so no fast charging.4. Not for multi tasking people.5. Camera and sound average6. Processor and touch very slow7. Only 6GB RAM AND 128 GB ROM is good  in this phone.8. Also it's not showing dual 4G9. Battery is only 1 day at normal uses.10. Display dpi is also very low.11. Can be treated as entry level phone.12. WhatsApp Camera function is abnormal, don't waste money on OPPO A31"
2,This product details said there is a earphone and screen protector.  But i didnt get that
5,The phone is excellent but if the front and rear camara should be high and should be their dark mode compalsary but it should be added fastly and should give ear phonesonly main default is not nice camara should be high because the less cost mobiles will take more tean agers so they do moor selfies so it should increase and oppo is the selfie expert but this phone no selfie expert camara for next phone it should increase .Imay think I will increase
3,"I like the product. But as compared to my other phone Realme X2. I found the lag in processing in some of minor things also. It is having 6GB RAM then also the having some processing issue. I don;t like the product. Even after this specs, the things are getting lag."
1,"Screen quality is very poor , camera is also nearly poor, all over the phone is worst. I ordered this phone by choosing the no cost emi option of Bajaj , but they are also taking the processing charges of Rs.174 on every instalment.So please don‚Äôt use Bajaj‚Äôs emi option for ordering this phone. Thanks"
1,"i have received the waste and damaged products and i chasing the customer support from last 10 days no solution upto now waste of money on  amazon ,waste of time on amazon ,and i customer of amzaon from last 5 years and i am a prime member this is the services i am getting"
3,Updating after 4month :-screen recorder not available..which is default function of every android now a days..-Charging draining faster but charging gaining very slower.-its not a 21st century phone .. so many basic features missing Day 1: experience:-Most important : it will not redirect the link into the present app in mobile .... It will open link every times in default browser..Eg: if I got any Facebook /insta /Twitter link and I already have installed these app then it will not asking me to get open with app instead it will redirect to browser and again I need to login... So so poor technology1.processor looks slow while setup and configuration my account data restoration as compare to redmi note 7 (same price older version phone than this)2. Camera quality is very low both back and front ...capture blurred images..not focusing the face even after setup manually.3.  Not value for money.. I think I made mistake to choose oppo brand .. I compare all the feature with redmi.. redmi looks far better than this..4. No front flash light available to click in night5. Looks slow to handle multiple apps compare to redmi6. Please don't buy this phone..this is so poor technology phone..
3,Headsets are missing in the phone box...where are the original headsets...its normally included in phonebox??
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
3,Camera quality is low
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.

1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
1,Dont buy this it is not worth for money. It is working slow
5,Pros:-1. Display (Best display you can get at this price i.e.  Super Amoled with 90Hz Refresh Rate2. üîã Battery (6000 mAh big battery)3. Camera ( 64 mp) and selfie (20 mp) and if you  know you know samsung image processing  software.4. Looks and back Design ( Awesome Pattern with  rainbow üåà reflection.)5. Compact Size (6.4inches) not too big and not  too small.......handy..Cons:-1. Processor (mediatek helio g80) which is a low  end processor and it might not affect your  overall performance if you are not a heavy  gamer or something like that.2. Infinity U display. Nowadays drop notch display  is kinda outdated look since overall look of the  phone is great but this small thing is like a black  spot on a white chart paper.##But Also keep that in Mind how can you get  everything in just 14999 -17999 ........in mid  range...these specs are perfect and at last you  can trust the brand name too.üòè
4,Cons:1.Good phone at this price.2.Display Quality is really great. Looks premium3.Camera is also very nice in daylight. In indoor it takes some shacky images.4. For Normal use I think it is best phone considering Samsung √Ämoled display and security.CONS:1. Could have been better if it comes with strong processor2. Samsung should have provided a Back case3. This phones support 25w charger but only 15w charger is provided so there must be 25w charger in the box
4,"I am sure there will be many reviewers who will do an in-depth analysis and list out the pros and cons of the device. So here i am pointing out the negatives that i felt . First thing first, the ring volume is mediocre. Ring is not at all loud and i wondee whether I have recieved a faulty device.Second thing i loathe is that, the back cover is a fingerprint magnet. Some kind of resin or composite material is used.To be honest, i didn't like the phone much. The design is outdated and sub par a 10k phone. Since bought this for an elderly person, the ring volume was a total bummer for me. Thats it, another useless review from me."
1,"I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company"
1,"So greatful to Amazon for sending me such a nice product which has already landed in samsung service centre twice within one month of purchase, it was possible only when amazon refused to take back the product within the return period even though they've so called 'no questions asked' return policy.Above all Samsung did a great jod too by keeping the phone with themselves for 10 days now, sometimes I forget that I just bought a new phone because either it's not with me most of the times or it is sick.Lastly Amazon didn't even bother to reply back to my grievances.Hats off to you guys."
1,"Believe me, it's the slowest mobile I saw. Don't go on screen and Battery, it is an extremely slow mobile phone and takes ages to open and navigate. Forget about heavy use, it can't handle normal regular use. I made a huge mistake but pls don't buy this mobile. It's only a few months and I am thinking to change it. Its dam SLOW SLOW SLOW."
1,"Big major charging issue, charging icon is seen during charging but charging is not increased, that's a very bad or not exceptable by samsungConclusion- company target is money making not making a quality device üò°Now my money is loss and we are crying üò≠üíîüò¢"
1,"This phone is not different then other Samsung phone.  Yeh log but be cheater hai , kuch bhi change nhi . 31 ka 32 fir krenge 33 . Battery utni bilkul nhi jitna Shor mcha rhe hai. Service ek dam ghatiya. Pause Jeb me darkness ke baad uchi deewaar par Chad jaate hai. Please don't  buy Samsung Mobiles more. Ab ye vo people wali companies nhi rhi."
1,Samsung  is forcing the user to install all the junk applications  in our phone.even the Ota update installing the junks.Performce of the phone is pretty decent.Camera is also giving the good shots but the junk app spoiling the party.More than a samsung phone you are purchasing  bundle of junk applications
1,Worst camera. Seems like camera of local phone.  Returning this back.Too heavy. Don‚Äôt know why they are considering that 64 mp. Poor camera quality.
1,1. Heavy heat on both the sides. Front and back also.2. Charging is very slow.
1,Terrible phone. Always hang and unusable. Returning the product. Don't buy this
5,"Processer is good.Both side Camera performance is good.Camera functions is work properly.In Screen look use face sacaner than fingerprint.Provide pre-installed apps Samsung system,  Microsoft system, Google system and Netflix's ,Amazon, etc.Charging capacity is too low, take 1¬Ω hr to charge.Fingerprint sacaner too small, many times its doesn't match.Lots of app pre-installed.25GB memory used out of 128."
3,"I'm a just a basic user of phones.  No movies, no games.  I mainly use phone, messages, photos, chats and other social apps and some utilities.  For the price, the features seem impressive and for my mild usage this phone sounds great.What I did not like is the amount of apps that were already installed on the phone!  Then I had to un-select a whole bunch of ""recommended"" apps during setup.  I was pre-subscribed to 'diagnostics' and 'recommendation' and 'marketing' notification by default!  Is that allowed?  Some features don't work unless I use specific apps.  Basically, they are app features and not phone features.  Sounds 'grey-area' to me.After spending half a day to go through all the settings and clean up the mess I think I'm ready to use this phone.  I still wonder what else I missed..."
1,Don't buy this mob... Camera performance is worse than 8k mob... Battery backup gives 1days.. On 60ghz..... 15k wasted.. No nfc...  Lost trust on Samsung.
1,I am fully disappointed with this model.perfomance wise not good . Operating app is also slow taking so much time to open and download app .aslo taking so much time to charge after 40 % any mobile take 45 to 60 min to full charge but this mobile take around 90 to 120 min to charge.not worth it .not recommended to any one .
5,My review after a week of usagepros-------*Battery - lasting for 2 days*Display - Great AMOLED display*Separate slot for memory card*Camera is also goodcons-------*Sometime touch is not working.*Battery - taking 3 hours to get fully charged. Nowadays we can get phone charged within 2 hours*Notification light is missing. Every time we need to on the button to check whether we have received any calls or messages*It is said that 15w charger but in adapter it says 10w (5.0 V = 2.0 A)*Too much of unwanted apps are pre-installed*Very outdated processor.
1,Battery Life is very poor .Even though it is 6000 mah battery it doesn't last a full day and needs to be charged atleast twice a dayEven though it is less than one month it's UI constantly stops and have to be closed.The response is extremely poor .I have been using One Plus 5 for the past 2 and half years and its response is better than this new device which is hanging and apps are crashing time and again .I had preferred an Indian phone to Chinese one but have been extremely disappointed with the performance of this phone
2,"I don't suggest to buy this m32 mobile, there is no extra features as they mentioned in their options, there they mentions atmos dolby sound, but third class sound in speakers and that option is not working, secondly palm swipe for screen shot is not working camera is so so, very bad product from samsung, I tried all the ways to take screen shots using palm swipe but I can't, if possible pls replace with another item mr amazon"
5,"Amazing phone. I would rank it the best overall phone experience. The pros are obviously known to everyone, the 90hz display is great. The touch feel is literally like butter. Cameras are great. Amazon prime runs in HD so widewine l1 is there. Speakers are loud, not tinny but lack bass. Can't complain.Phone requires careful first time setup to avoid ads as suggested by ranjit sir. No ads encountered yet. Everything works well, side mounted power button /finger print reader is fast and accurate. Light sensor, proximity sensor are flawless. These 2 are typically bad in Chinese phones (mi note 5 pro user) causing display to turn on when in call, so thumbs up.The cons: the processor seemed weak on paper, but the experience is great. Not that I am defending samsung, but a compromise 90% can blindly make. I do not play games, so can't say much but better processor phones out there. This is for general public who wants smooth experience of samsung phone and no software bugs.Some complained of emmc5 storage, but apps installed damn fast and I did not find and sluggish read write speed issue. Fast and phone did not heat during setup process when installing 100s of apps and no slowness observed. I have 2 m30s in house, they also pointed out better build quality, better looks of my black version and fluidity of screen. Good for light gaming. Go ahead with the phone for good vibes throughout phones life. Now samsung is giving 3 years of software updates, so great."
1,"This is my first review of Any product purchsed online. I'm shopping online since ages now. But this Phone FORCED me to write a review.I've been Using Asus Zenfone phones till date for my usage, Had a wonderful experience....First time ever shifted to Samsung just because of so called Brand Name.WORST DECISION.Camera OK.Battery OK.Performance OK.Screen OK.Brightness OK.Within 1 week Lock switch stopped working.I'm locking and unlocking by screen tap option because samsung people have said it'll take time to repair.Body completely cheap plastic material.Heats up with normal usage.When in pocket automatically wakes up and starts typing numbers or dials emergency number.With No disregard to Samsung I'm saying very bad phone you've made.Very overpriced. Should be of 9k or less.Others opinions may differ from me. This is just my personal experience.I'm sorry to give you less stars Samsung but please improve your quality not quantity. There is no mandate to launch new phone every week."
1,"Display is good and bright. Battery  average. It's not that speed being 6gb ram, while making  call it lags. Camera not upto mark, I miss grand camera which was better  than 64 mp. Over priced, don't have basic features  of other M series phone. On the name of brand Samsung started cheating people.  They should  atleast  provide  cover."
3,"After purchasing Samsung M12, was looking forward to getting M31, but the mobile was not available and the prices increased. After waiting for a month, saw that M32 is available so purchased it but not entirely happy with it. The phone rings on its own at times, chimes continuously other times without any call or notification being given. Phone lags at time and opening apps also takes time. Perhaps the 6gb variant is better but I have 4gb model. OneUI was supposed to be stable and I am quite disappointed with this particular purchase at least."
4,Pros: Screen resolution is good. Speed and performance is ok ok. Sometimes got little sluggy during parallel execution. Camera is very good quality. Battery life is good. SW is really smooth. Speaker is louder enough. Finally it's not a Chinese brand.Cons: No 4k or HDR video viewing. So some videos are blurry even though it is HD. During charging phone gets heated up. Tats may be it has bigger battery. 5G support is not Der since most phones are now with 5G. Price might have been little less to compete Chinese brands.

5,"Using since last three days ...completely satisfied with everything. In this segment so many phones are available but if i get the SAMSUNG then why i should go anywhere else...Pros:Display - SAMOLED with Full HD, Side Curves make you feel so happy. Brightness is awesome.Sound - Dolby Sound is also good specially with wired headphone.Battery - Without internet 2 days do not worry to charge it and with internet one full day.Call Quality : Also goodVideo Calling - BestCamera : Picture is so goodProcessor - Fast as it comes with 90Hz refresh rate.Cons:Notification LED Indicator is missing but can be managed.RAM could be 8 GB but if you choose the quality then it can be also ignored. 6GB also working fine.Verdict: If you are not a GAMER then blindly you can grab it."
5,"Good camera features,Good display quality,Good battery backup,"
2,"Best camera quality at 15k Not for gamers only for simple multimedia use and want a secure phone. Yes it lags too much on normal and heavy use .No carrier aggregation by samsung prosser support carrier aggregation only 3 thing is good about this phone camera,display and battery"
1,Camera quality not good and battery backup very bad.üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
4,"best Non-Chinese smartphone preference under 15K | Excellent battery | Decent Camera | Smooth | Stylish look | Mummy Loved it ( I gifted it to her)Not made for chhapri youth icons of India.Not the best camera phone under 15K.for gaming under 15k > Motorola G40 / POCO is better option.if you are a decent user, who loves to watch videos/ browse social apps then definitely go for this.for Mumma/PAPA this would be best choice rather than Chinese smartphones.(Thumbs UP) BATTERY : Screen On Time > More than 13H for Mumma. she watches Jio Tv & browse social apps quite often.(Processor) MTK G80 doesn't lag much as compare to Exynos processors + it is better optimized for battery consumption. example Samsung M21 2021 with same 6k mAh battery with Exynos processor gives 7-9h Screen on time only, while Samsung m32 with same 6K mAh battery with MTK Processor gives more than 10-12H screen on time."
5,"Value for money and best is 90hz super amoled display and 64mp quad camera. Best for listening music and watching videos as it has 6000mah battery goes 1+1/2 day ""but this phone is not for gaming"""
2,"Seeing few YouTube videos,I purchase it,  It's 7-Days now.Processor is G80 , Which Don't support 90Hz& Don't support 2k Videos & Pics.,But, People who use for minimum usage like 2-3hr YouTube,  Amazon videos good.Most time it's 60hz , so, u feels Videos üìπlag ,When u take FHD pic it takes 2-4sec to save it.I am feeling M40 which I got 3-years back is much faster..So, Always go with Snapdragon processor.."
5,"The youtuber reviews will tell you that this phone doesn't have a powerful processor that others will offer you at this price range. It is a fantastic mobile for an average user like me. You should have to look what your purpose of the mobile you want purchase. If you want to play games like pubg and you want professional video/photoshoot this phone is not definitely not for you. It is good to watch youtube videos at high quality with samsung's amazing samoled screen, it can take some good photos and videos and can do some games even pubg at minimal settings.I thing like this people who drive  vehicle at a speed of 60 k.m per hour wants a car that have very powerful engine and they will never need that much power. Like that I don't need a very high performing processor and other features that I may not use.So think, if you are a person who only wants to use mobile for to make and take call and watch videos and occasionally wants to play some game, then this mobile is definitely for you.My job is some what risky and I need automatic call recorder to deal with my risky customers. This mobile has that feature. Its my purpose and that's why I bought this phone.Its a good phone an average customer."
2,Waste of money. Don't but this phone. I'll not recommend it to anyone. Today I received  this and within 24 hours am reviewing  the product.  It's not worth . Camera is bad. MI is much much much better. I shud have listed to other reviews  before buying this.
5,"In love with this beast in reasonable price, camera quality is really great, screen resolution is far far clear and colour full, battery is strong, light weight, compact size, all required smart phone features are build in the phone. Good job Samsung team."
1,Do not buy. There are plenty of other good options for the price. Main issue is the PROCESSOR.  I just felt it's too slow compared to  the mobiles available.  Phone is also bit thick . And I think its manufacturing is stoped too.  It's only sold online. If I had a chance I would buy a different phone .
4,"From my usage over a month and taking it to a trip where network reception was absent 90% of the time, my reviews are this:-Display is great, surely compares to flagship devices, the sAMOLED Infinity-U display is really something else, bright, brilliant, vibrant and with the 90Hz refresh rate (laggy animations appear sometimes), quite responsive too. It is miles ahead from smartphones in this range.-Camera is pretty nice actually and surprised me a bit, especially from budget Samsung line, however, it does have a habit of oversaturation in some minuscule scenarios, low-light photography is average, just average as can be expected from phones of this range.-Battery is AVERAGE at best, please keep this in mind before buying, don't let the 6000mah figure fool you, for powering a display of that much calibre the battery lasts a day to a day and half depending on usage but NOT more than that in any case. The 15w charger provided requires a good 2-2.5 hours to charge up the 6000mah battery. 90hz display is a battery drainer, so I set mine on 60hz for the trip, for office/home scenario where frequent charging is not an issue 90hz is great albeit laggy animations appear sometimes.-Back panel is polymer based and is prone to fingerprints, smudges and scratches, so a light case is the right way to go.-Network reception is great for both WiFi and cellular and does not suffer from the low signal issues faced by some M31 users, etc. Bluetooth works well too.-Fingerprint sensor is snappy but coming from a phone where it was present on the back, it takes time getting used to and is sometimes just a tad bit slow, nothing to worry about.-External speaker volume is bad to average, it is not at all loud, I am not criticising this, maybe a lot a of people prefer quiet phone speakers but it is sometimes hard to hear ringtone or notification sounds especially from a phone where notification LED is absent.-Always on Display is present but reduces the battery percentage 1-2% at most.Summing up the above, overall, great viewing experience, camera is alright, battery is average, speakers are disappointing.-STRICTLY NOT a performance beast by any means, great for everyday or business usage. NOT for gaming.-Have not observed heating issue as of yet.Hope this helps, Cheers!"
4,"Don't waste money on redmi or realme jst in sake for money. This phone is very nice for decent users. It is an all-rounder in all tasks, but for decemt usage. Camera is very nice than redmi, realme, oppo etc. Notch is very small and does not disturb. One UI 3.1 has tons of features to customize. My rating 8.5/10.All the Best!"
1,Cons: 1) Slow processing2) Getting error messages like Sim refresh3) Some time call does not get connect..However after restart call gets connected...but this happened quite sometimes..Hence it's main function of mobile is not 100%Pro: 1) Camera2) Battery life so far good.As this phone is slow from now not sure how it will perform after 6 to 12 months. And hence giving 1 ratings.Learning/ Suggestions one should  buy a good processor phone...
1,Don't buy this phone
1,Front camara worrest
1,"Front camera is worst , I doubt does it really have a 50 MP Rear camera  ...after 2 days of using mobile , YouTube was not responding , and many such apps weren't responding named Music , Gallery etc"
1,"Firstly camera quality is not upto mark.Mobile get hang, while accessing any applications call applications will get disappear from the screen when mobile get hang.....don't buy this mobile phone this is  my personal suggestion."
2,disappointment from front camera performance below average very bad performance. and then everything is average
3,Front camera is not working properly. The image and video is blur.
1,Totally waste of money and camera quality is very bad and processer is not good
1,Sim slot is not working
2,"Please must read my review before u buying, now I am using redmi note 10 , I bought note 10 for 14k(6+128), it is great value for money, but redmi 10 prime cost is 12.5k (4+64)  which is very very high price according to its quality of features, front camera captures like 5mp, it is not an 8mp camera, even back camera 50 mp also captures washed out pictures, in the camera department completely utterflap redmi this time, charging time is very long because of battery 6000mah , display is not upto the mark but ok, sound output is good, only main speaker is loud and other is low sound, call quality ok, design good, I had used redmi note 8 before redmi note 10, it is the best value for money under 10k But now redmi 10 prime is not upto the mark for this price, please go to note 10 don't buy redmi 10 prime"
5,Nothing to dislike.. Everything good
5,"Posting review after 12 days if use.The phone is absolutely gorgeous! The body is plastic but the quality is not compromised. Tempered glass was already applied and the touch works with even a featherlight touch. Moving between apps is extremely fluid. I'm not much of a games, but the candy Crush works fine.The camera is beyond my expectation. Many reviews sat it's not good, but I found the picture quality and effects to be at par with sony camera.Only thing I don't like is the missing notification indicator. I miss important and urgent messages due to its absence. Apart from that, the best phone I've personally used!"
4,Front camera is not optimised and up to the mark back camera is not optimised.Performance is average . Display quality good.Sound quality superb. Bigger battery gives boosts . Some minor glitches that can be fixed afterwards through updates. Overall good for normal usage .
4,"Outstanding device.The phone design is so premium, but actually it's plastic body. The phone comes with amazing features and great processor in it's price range. In this budget segment I've used Samsung and Realme devices also. But, this Redmi 10 Prime is best among them.The only cons is that the camera is not upto the mark and if you're not regular Redmi phone user then you will have to modify lot of things in this device to make it handy."
4,Received phone today.. Quite nice phone. Need to learn how to take pictures with 50mb cam.. All good
1,"Its very simple, ""I shouldn't have bought this mobile"""
5,Excellent mobile phoneExcellent cameraGood battery lifeExcellent displayAll things are excellent in the mobile go for it ....
5,"Battery backup was nice. Yes it does take a bit longer to charge, but at least in my case that wasn't a problem.Camera was nice unlike the other comments I read before I bought the phone. There are some problems though. The fingerprint sensor is terrible. Sometimes it just wouldn't open (that happens rarely but it does happen) and I would have to put the pin manually.Design looks great, display looks great. I didn't face any brightness issues outdoors so no regret of buying it.The stereo speakers are just fine, and so far the phone never heated up after charging or game usage.It ticked all my boxes."
1,"Please don't buy these cheap and worst camera mobile. Company claims 1st 50 MP camera , which takes picture worse than 5 mp camera. Need explanation from Amazon for giving wrong information to customers and cheating with seller. I'll give -5 for camera quality"
1,Wrost phone plzz not buy waste of money camera quality is very bad only features showen highlightly but they or not according to as they are shown 50 mg camera like 13 megapixel selfie camera is wrost in light mode you feel camera is wrost dark photos are click
1,"So many issues with this model, I have used many mi phones but this is the fist time I have faced so many issues with this model, fist of all about camera, front camera is very poor clarity, 2nd is wifi signal strength receiving is also poor, so many lags in miui 12.5, contact & dailing Google app has so many issues, mi dailing & contact's was very good and user friendly why I don't know that was changed to Google app, I didn't like Google contact app and it has so many issues, and there are so many software issues in 12.5 update also. I am a big fan of mi products & after using this model I changed my mind & want to shift to other company. In that way the phone model has impacted me. Finally I sincere suggestion you don't buy this model if you are using this phone for video calls at least."
5,overall very nice product
5,Best in the market till nowPrevious I had a Note 7 pro that was too fabulousNow I own a 10 primeü§©ü§©ü§©
1,The camera stands out and is a bit better when compared with a VGA cam on a feature phone.
1,High price low quality
3,"I bought this Redmi 10 Prime during Great Indian Festival. Order received 4th October. Packaging is good.About Redmi 10 Prime:Pros :Good screen size, Primary camera, battery backup as used for 3 days on first charge,body dimensions etcCons:Selfie camera 8 megapixel as in catalogue,but I disappointed in room light ,it gives a dull image. I have Asus Zenfone 3 Max having 5Mp gives a clear photo in selfie ü§≥ .  I have a 3 Star üåü ating  for the overall Mobile Phone, Fingerprint and Face unlock not set.Will review again after 3 months. Price can be reduced to 13000 for 6 GB 128 GB phone. As I got a feedback that phone is selling at same rate at local mobile shops, then why advertising best year offer.."
1,I bought this phone only coz it has 50mp camera but it's been a week I have using the phone and it's totally totally worst camera ever.. Any 10year old basic camera phone is better than this.Along time this even the performance is not great or would be usuable for any basic games..Pricing is too highOnly power backup is goodPlease don't buy this phone
5,Nice...thanq
4,"Call recording built-in feature is pathetic as user has to manually click on call record option for each call while the call is going on, then it notifies both caller and receiver saying this call is being recorded which really sounds awkward and the apps available in play store for auto call recording does not work....please don't buy this mobile if you need to auto record calls.Other than this rest of the features are as expected for this price range"
1,Don't wait for updates. Go for other models.Update won't change this product. Build quality not all good.We are fool already purchased. You guys aware of this.Only positive about this phone is battery.
2,All features is so good but camera is very poor
4,"I have had used many Redmi phones. I am comparing this with my Poco M2 Pro:1. Narzo sure does feel premium compare to Poco. It's OS is clean and blotware free.2. Narzo feels much lighter, but I weigh on scale Poco and Narzo weighs the same. I think Narzo has better weight distribution.3. Camera is good. I feel no difference compare to Poco. Night camera is average, it cannot capture all the details what our eyes can see in low light. Poco too doesn't fair well in low light.4. Calling is okay. Speaker volume is much low: forget using speaker phone. Poco has very loud speaker volume. This is only downside.5. I liked Amazon giving flat exchange for older phones, albeit lower than Flipkart. Flipkart devalued my phone further upon inspection even though phone met all the checks.6. Summary, if you are tired of using Redmi phones, this is better option @ 10K."
5,"Very happy with Realme UI and the phone‚Äôs build quality. I was not happy with Redmi phone OS and wanted Realme phone for my mom around 10K. This one is really good. Pleasantly surprised that the user interface is on par with Google Pixel 4a stock Android. Weight of the phone is evenly distributed, so won‚Äôt feel its heavy. Not very bulky and good battery backup as well. I think Realme should be the brand to go for budget phones. Yes there are so many models, but we have many options to choose."
5,Good

4,"Best Phone for Long Battery Backup, Gaming, Bright Display & Camera. No hang while using smartphone. smooth experience, best UI.Camera: 4/5Battery: 5/5Display: 4/5Performance: 5/5"
1,Most worst part of it is Amazon is backing it and causing problems to the customer. Please don't buy this product especially from Amazon. In India there is trust issues..
2,"First of all those who wants best performance phones can buy this and don't expect anything other than this.Pros:Super performanceBattery lifeRealme UI 2.0Cons:1. Camera ( Worst even if it 50MP it takes pictures like 5MP. Front camera is too dull.  My old Redmi 4 phone gives good front cam quality than this. Front cam worst.2. Display (It gives 360pixel output when videos Play in 720p. Even 720p wallpaper also displays like 320p)At least they should give FHD display.Even 9K price we get FHD display.3. No case provided, no inbuilt tamper glass( For this price these to be included in the box)4. Last but not the least, Overpriced. These featured phone to be come in 9000/-This is my review frnds, those who needs only performance can buy this. For other features don't buy."
1,battery issue and SIM card slot 2nd not working; Call Amazon Customer support they are not even trying to help me over this issue saying you need to wait for some time instead also checked by their tech support team in all ways by downloading the app and performing the test.So not recommended the Purchase of a Phone over Amazon like a lot of issues and not resolution with Tech-Support.Rather buy from somewhere else.
1,Plz don't buy itWorst camera phone taking selfie like cheap VGA cameraFront and back both camera worst.It's a joke of 50mp actually it's 8 or 5 mp camera.Don't waste ur hard earn money on such a garbage mobile
1,"There is no official Information, If it has gorilla glass.They do not provide back cover only Screen Protect Film is provided."
3,Realme should change the audio jack spot it should be placed in above side it very very wrost and bad because due to this the earphone get out of oder to many times my 2-3 earphone has been get out of oder
4,First impression is amazing in this segment.
5,Nice phone good camera and sound quality fast charing nd many more features at ds price .
5,Realme made a very good product at this price range.I buyed this on Great India sell so i got some discount.Battery life is good.Camera is good but not like 50mpxl.Display quality is also good and there is no issues regarding brightness.Overall good product
5,"Thanks to amazon for this product  & for your best services you always provide.  Fast delivery, nice packing by amazon.This phone looks good. Blue color looks cool. Camera is ok not looks like 50mp but it's ok. Battery back up is also fine. Speaker sound is also fine.I got what I wanted. Face unlock feature, fingerprint sensor, fine camera, fine speaker quality, good battery back up, 128 gb ample storage, 4gb ram. I think these are the features which most of the people want. I don't know whether it has the gorilla glass or not.At Rs 9,999, I bought this phone & I am satisfied. Looks are also good."
3,No screen protector film and case in this box as written in the discription.Thats disappointing.
1,"Sound Is very low , phone touch don't work properly, hangs very slow ,  camera is worst ever came across , don't scan QR code before 5 minutes (for whats app web)Good for calling and receiving calls (basic use) because of battery 6000 mah ..Do not come under honey trap of discount , useless model so heavy discountWasted money , as Amazon return policy is poor ,No support after sale , trust app not the technician who visited to check"
1,No replacement first time in history product defected unavailable to teke photoFlash light intensity very low
3,"Hi, I was quite unhappy with this phone. Video calls and speaker calls sound is very low. Unwanted pre install apps are crowded. Major issue is regarding sound quality. Media sound is low even on full volume. Neede to review after one moth. Will update more."
1,"Camera quality is so poor, is not like 50 mp camera."
3,Issue only Charger box(big Box look like) other all things everything perfect Thank you Real me
5,Good
1,Camera doesn't look proper.  My advice don't purchase this mobile.
3,"Average performance in such price range. More value for money is expected from Realme.1. Average Camera Quality. Definitely not real 50 MP. Not more than 13 MP.2. Below Average Refresh Rate in this price.3. Infinix offers better phones in 30 % lesser cost and better features.4. Getting just 40% exchange value for just a month old device.5. No Back Case and screen protector.6. Looks Good but delivers less.REALME PUT THEIR PRODUCTS IN EOL ""End of Life"" Series right after 12-18 Months.YOU WON'T GET THE CONSUMABLES LIKE BATTERY AND OTHER PARTS EVEN FROM THEIR AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTRES. I EXPERIENCED THE SERVICE RELATED ISSUE WITH MY PREVIOUS PHONE REALME U1. I HAD TO SELL IT FOR PEANUTS.REALME EXPECTS PEOPLE TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY A WHOLE PRODUCT INSTEAD OF ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF PAID SERVICE AND SPARE PARTS FOR ATLEAST 3 YEARS."
1,Accessories missing  *CASE*  not receive in box..same informed to Amazon..Cameras quality not good as aspects..
2,Mobile is ok. But camera clearly is not good in this megapixel.... Isko update kr ke sudhar karna chahiye...
1,"Totally waste of moneyCamera quality very bad 50mp  camera equal to 12mpDisplay only hd+ not FHD+Battery performance not goodCharger support 18w it's very bad for this price rangeProcessor G85 performance not goodPLEASE CHOOSE ANOTHER BRAND ONTHIS PRICE RANGELIKE POCO M3, POCO M2 PRO, REDMI 9 POWER,"
5,"If you are looking for a budget smartphone that has good battery life, then definitely go for this. The charging time is a bit too much but justifies because it has a 6000MaH battery. The overall performance and UI of Color OS are pretty good which was astonishing because I thought it would be like MI phones which turned out to be wrong. Realme is doing a good job by making such budget smartphones. Would love this phone if it has a higher charging speed, an AMOLED screen, a good camera with a wide-angle lens. Apart from that, it is perfect."

1,"Worst Mobile, switch off more than 10 times in a day not even restart, Amazon has not given the refund only return. Really very very worst. Processor is slow, so many apps works very slowly, cam is ok, battery is good. Above all swithoff so many times very very worst. Don't buy, Amazon cheating customers really shame"

4,"Hopefully, a fair review after 24 hours of usage.Pros:1. Camera (both front and back) - A very decent one even on low lights.2. Huge battery backup - It can really withheld for 3 days for day to day usage.3. Performance - Fair one TBH. Obviously G35 at this price range is upto industry standards.4. Android 11 out of box. Hope Tecno keeps the device updated for next two years.5. Display - Bright and crisp (though 269ppi). But upto standards and smooth touch sensitive.6. Flash lights - Perfect and bright 4 LEDs at back and two in front. Front LED is also bright enough. One of it lights up during charge inlet with dimmed brightness.7. A plastic back case and screen protector film (already applied).Cons:1. Missing Type-C. It is micro USB.2. Battery - Charging duration takes ages. 3+ Hours!!3. Finger print scanner - one of worst at this price range. You had to adjust the finger to find right spot.4. Bloatware - Huge list of uninstalable list of apps.5. Front LEDs - No option to be used for notification alerts.To conclude, good one at this price range. But honestly, it could have been a 500 bucks more lesser considering branding which is striving to come up. One can easily go for top brands in market for the same configuration with and additional 500 bucks. Hopefully, Tecno doesn't let their customer down like the way other few brands did."
1,Very poor quality phone don't buy this phone phone is very slow and hanging problem heating problem also

1,"Bad camera, bad display ,loudspeaker too low,over weight totally waste product don't buy this phone. go other like realme C21 narzo 30a is better then this phone"
1,Very bad camera quality
5,"Its a value for money phone. You can't expect smooth performance from a low budget phone like this. But this is a very good mobile for daily uses.With heavy uses it gives 2days battery life.Both the cameras are on par. Nothing great, nor bad.Lots of bloatware on the UI.Loudspeaker volume is little low, but sound while calling is very clear and high.Overall it's a good phone for the people who have tight budget or doesn't need super camera/gaming experience."
1,Worst sound quality 1st day hang finger print not work properly totally unsatificed with this mobile. I was asking about return this prodcut but amazon is refuse this i lost 9000 rs. I am never ever buy from amazon. Totally dissapointed
1,"Used phone recievedVery disappointed, I am returned this phone"
3,"There is some lag while opening apps, speaker quality is not good, otherwise everything is good at this price (got at ‚Çπ7999)"
4,"Camera is not up to the markHave lots of new features like extract data from secomd phoneBattery backup is goodBack cover is fantasticMusic I mean speaker is not upto the markLack of smoothness  to touch the phoneHios is not good to carry g35, sometimes it shows lagging issueLots of hios appsOverall it's good in price range of 7999"
4,"*PROS -1.Battery backup is amazing.2.Rear camera quality is awesome, Front camera quality is good.3.phone design is unique & attractive.*CONS -1.Support only 10W charging.2.Only one Speaker for both calling & Music.3.Fingerprint sensor very bad,It doesn't work properly, it works 4/10 times.I give 0 rating for fingerprint sensorSo,i said to tecno to fix this problem.,Otherwise phone is awesome."
4,Speaker quality is not upto the mark
3,Poor Product only thing that I liked is camera which is good at this price range... but other than that it hangs a lot...and heats up as well.. no recommended..this is my 1st and last tecno Product..bye bye tecno..
5,Camera is good & over all I'm satisfied
5,"Techno 7T------------Nice phoneDisplay is goodCamera is goodSpeaker is okay okayCall quality is goodFast processor and you can play games alsoOverall good experience and I think it's better than the most phones.Don't buy high end phones, it's a trap. It's a depreciating asset. It's going to die in one or max two years.Instead, buy a good home product for your wife mother or sister and live in a good environment.Jai HindHave a great day!"
5,"I bought this phone without knowing much about the company. It was just a gamble which paid off. I got it at Rs 7740, and comparing it's specifications with its price, I feel it is a steal deal.Pros at this price:6 gb RAM and 6 gb storage_5 starsCamera AI and 48 MP _5 starsFinger touch sensor_4starsFace unlock sensor_ 5 starsBattery life _ 4 starsTouch and feel _5 starsSoftware is similar to OPPo but response is better.Cons: a bit heavy ( may be due to huge battery)Overall a good purchase."
3,Good phone in this price segment.Pros-1. Better battery performance2. 48mp camera3. Unique designCons-1. Major cons _ fingerprint is not good.It works worse.i have never seen this type of fingerprint in smartphones in last 5 years.2. Micro usb cable3. Speaker quality4. Location of power button.
3,"Review after 40days of use , The net speed is mostly bytes /sec. not connecting to online classes at this speed. I haven't seen in bytes /sec.  in my other mobiles. To attend online classes mobile data is not going to be used as the speed is b/ s.  The mobile has good features 4gb RAM 64gbROM, 48MP rear camera  + AI camera, front camera 8MP, 6000mah battery @ Rs 8000 is  good but netspeed in this phone disappointed alot.  If you watch movies or attend online meetings then don't ................................ don't ................ ."
2,"Average quality. But I bought this phone with 48mp camera's expectations. I'm disappointed. My vivo phone's 13 mp camera quality is far far better than this. Finger print is always a problem. Sometimes touch screen also not working properly. Even though it has a 4gb ram and 64 memory I additionally added a 64 gb samsung memory card,, All after this phone is hanging and lagging..even contacts is opening slow. I don't have any big games on my phone though. Inbuilt palm store ads are coming daily to install some apps. Everything inside is Google's including Dialer. It has call recording option but you cannot record a call without other parties knowledge. When we press record or put it in auto record it says NOW THE CALL IS BEING RECORDED loudly. Which can be heard from both sides speakers. We are using record option for our safety purpose. If someone is harassing or bullying or even blackmailing how will we handle that. It is not women friendly mobile.. I suggest women not to buy this phone."
5,"Camera - Nice camera quality as it has one AI Camera so it makes picture so much brighter.Battery - Battery is awesome, very good battery backup. Even after 2 hour continuous gaming, battery gives great backup.Processor - No lag at all if you are doing gaming or anything, it's performance is awesome.Best phone by tecno in this price. You should go for it ...."
4,"Previous owner of Redmi 7 2gb 32gbRedmi Note 10 4gb 64gb was blazing fastIf you aren't able to buy this wait till Xiaomi release the same in poco with 6gb ram for the same price, like they did with Redmi power with a downgrade in camera, They won't remove the 48mp camera, They may decrease or remove the remaining cameras in poco version of resmi note 10About Amazon sale I logged in to amazon.in in my pc and clicked on join wait list around 12:02, then opened the app and booked the phone I was in queue for almost 20 to 25 minutes, the next step was payment which was a pain in the head, no COD, Note: only upi ids with number@ are accepted, I added a card Note: Check if ecommerce payments is enabled for your cardIn the allocated 15 minutes the order was booked but payment failed, thankfully I was allowed to pay againAlso while I was waiting in queue I got an option to buy the phone 2 ways, lightning deal - 11998, Regular price - 11999 (in Amazon App), I think lightning deal is for those who want to claim offersFirst of all, i bought this phone for basic use online payments, govt apps like Twallet, Tration, Tappfolio, MyGHMC, Digilocker, Aadhaar, Hpgas, Bharatgas, Hmwssb and much more all of them mostly dual appsI am a pc user so I don't use my mobile for gaming or streamingPros:Display : The display is crisp and clear better than my Redmi 7 (not comparing LCD with Amoled)Touch: The touch response is good it's fast, I can type fast in this phone no lag thereMobile data: 4g Data connectivity is superb I can feel the difference between my redmi 7 and this, mostly the download speedFeel: In hand feel is also good, the weight is lessCamera: Best in the segment (obviously if you don't use the stock app)Price: considering how this is priced more than Redmi Note 9 (10999), I am not angry this too will cost the same after 6 months probably will be on exchange and discount by August independence day sale.Cons:Battery: Being amoled this shouldn't consume so much battery, hope Xiaomi fixes this with an updatePlastic back: glossy back (should have come with matte or rough panel for better grip) and little bit of vibration while playing the speakers especially on top near cameraStereo speakers: yep more like dual speakers than stereo (then again Xiaomi never claimed that they support Dolby (Oppo has them and they sound awesome)Verdict: I was waiting for this from almost a year, from the launch of Redmi note 8 and my analysis went way deep, I was looking at Samsung for amoled, Redmi power for stereo speakers and good battery, Poco varient of Redmi note 9 for the processor and decent in the box fast chargerThis covered almost all of them (not fully though)Finally this just serves my purpose, I still aim to buy a good PC, Nothing can beat a desktop ( I wish remix os and phoenix os were as competitive as Windows, remix went out of play long back."
5,"Great product by redmi, but I request to redmi please don't make fake sale"
1,Never buy chip quality battery drain issues don't buy
5,"Finally, Xiaomi has decided to design for its Note series of mobiles. This mobile phone is definitely going to be and head Turner when you pull the mobile out of the pocket. It has an almost 1mm protruding camera module on the rear of the mobile. I have bought aqua-green color which has these light gradient shade. The colors are up to your personal preferences.The phone has a matte finish at the back so it is definitely not a fingerprint magnet. It also doesn't feel very heavy and is very easy to hold firmly.üéØDESIGN and DISPLAY:******************************This 6.43-inch display with the Full HD Plus resolution is really good along with a punch-hole selfie camera that offers a seamless user experience.The brightness can go up 1100 nits peak so it is definitely not a difficult thing to use it under sunlight. Xiaomi provided this model with the Widevine L1 DRM certification support for this mobile. So, playing HD videos on an ott platform won't be an issue.Z-axis haptic motor used in this mobile throws more realistic vibrations while playing games. I tried it extensively with a couple of games, the experience was really satisfying. Kudos to Xiaomi for throwing in all the sensors on this mobile especially for not giving up on the remote control sensor.This mobile comes with a lot of preloaded apps like Facebook, LinkedIn, MI remote, MI credit, MI Store, MI pay, share m, etc. Out of these, you can uninstall a couple of apps and you have to live with the remaining apps for the rest of the life.üéØPERFORMANCE:**********************The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and highly responsive that even if you touch the sensor unintentionally you will end up unlocking the phone. It is that fast. Games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty worked excellently without any lag or freezing. This mobile would definitely outscore any mobile under this budget easily.It took 25 to 35 minutes to charge the mobile from 0 to 75% using the 33 Watts charger which came along with the mobile.üéØCAMERA:**************It comes with the 48-megapixel F/1.79 main camera with Sony Sensor and an 8mp ultrawide camera and the remaining two are the macro and the depth sensor.The main camera will let you shoot 4K 30fps video and 960fps 720 p video. When provided with good lighting conditions the main camera gives you a decent output and the Portrait mode also did a good job by blurring out the background gently.The low light images were average and it was decent enough for mobile phones with a budget of 15k.Coming to the selfie camera The Portrait mode worked excellently and the pictures were on a little warm tone than a natural skin tone. If you don't like the warm tone on your selfie pictures then you can fix it through editing apps from Play Store.üéØVERDICT:**************This mobile offers Rock-solid performance for everyday tasks along with very good battery life. This mobile phone comes with MIUI 12.5 so you don't have to worry about future updates for at least the next two years. With AMOLED display and the stereo speakers along with IP53 rating, this has to be the most competent mobile phone under 15000 and a good value for money.I have a YouTube channel: Gizmofeatures (You can also find the unboxing and impressions video there). When Comparing with Poco M3, Moto G10 Power, Samsung M12, you can pick Redmi note 10 any day. It is the best among these Four."
5,Best phoneEver
1,Redmi note 10 software is very bad xiaomi please fix software problem's Improve the camera & build quality is not good & battery drain very fast.  I AM BIG FAN OF XIAOMI MY FAVORITE COMPANY
1,After 5 days used . Nice design but performance is not up to mark and lagging . App crashes . Lot of adds which is irritating. Best buy Oppo or Realme.
1,"Mobile is lagging. while I scrolling screen is not moving, I noticed it several times,it is very slow while playing games. product is not up to the mark in this price segment"
4,Everything is good in the phone..I use redmi note 10 for 1 day...And review itI found i issue with this phone that is fingerprint sensor does not work properly it slwo or some time Tap fingerprint sensor for 2-3 time for useAbout a camera very good...Front camera is also good..I will edit review after 10 day of use...In shot very GOOD PHONE
5,I pay 100rs extra for one-day delivery it took less than 20 hours.. And after 7 days of using I would say this the best budget smartphone to this day.. There is another variant that comes in 12k you can wait for that or simply buy this at 14000 it comes with a back cover and a screen protector battery backup is awesome but a slight heating issue I'm am getting...
1,Battery is very bad ...battery is draining when even phone is on sleep mode .
5,"Good picture quality. The 48 Mp camera works fine and so does the selfie camera in potrait mode. Sometimes the pictures are sharper than required. The charging is fast. Got full charge in 2.5 hours of fast charge. Overall build quality is good, not too heavy as compared to previous models. The plastic phone case provided prevents from ususal bumps and falls. The sound quality is decent and so is the video quality in full HD. Gaming performance is decent too, got to play need for speed in medium setting without crashing the app. Really happy with the purchase."
1,check wether both the speakers are working or noi got the manufacturing defet in a piece wich they have senteven the headphone jack also not upto the mark wich give you sound only in one ear bud
1,"The sd678 processor with 6GB of ram fails to keep up with everyday stuff like composing mails and browsing. Screen freezes at times, and touch response is far from adequate (and no, it is not because of the the protective film).Camera is average for this price range.The only good thing about this phone is its amoled display.It comes with the usual miui bloatware, but can uninstall/disable some.I understand these phones are not meant to last, nor do I expect flagship level performance for 14k; but this phone fails to perform even basic tasks where sub 10k phones ace.The finger print sensor is well placed amd fast, but often fails to work.There's no way to turn off fast charging, so expect your battery to give up soon."
5,"We loved it always, coz it's a no 1 brand.Exellent camera."
4,Display is very good  10/10Camera is good for the price 8/10Battery is very good 10/10Lightweight and very slimPerformance is decent not the best 7/10MIUI is very laggyBack panel quality is not goodDual stereo speakers not the loudest but ok

1,Don't purchase this phone battery problem and phone is running is slow
2,i have used this smartphone for couple of days and what i came across cons and pros will share1. display : best in this price range no doubt about that crisp colors little saturated as its amoled panel for viewing is a pleasure of eyes2. Speakers : i didn't liked it yes u heard it right its not good the highs as high vocals are not clear its like its been suppress the quality is not like stereo speakers type its same like single speaker its like u can heard the music but not the vocals the base is killed3 Battery : Not seems to be 5000 mah coz of 11nm chip its drains like hell even surfing would suck the battery juice like hell and phone heats up a lot yes it charge as fast as advertised apart from that nothing is good might be an update would resolve this issue have to wait and watch4. Camera : its good in the price range 48 mp does it job ultra wide macro depth are satisfactory not good not bad does there job colours are not accurate but it does happen low light pictures are ok not as advertised. camera gives good result in good light or in moderate like in room bit not good in low light or at nightselfie camera is good takes good shots edges in portrait are quiet well managed same in low light not good enough5. Built quality nice all plastic very light and easy to hold and operate with one hand if u have big hands but very light coz of all plastic body gorilla glass 3 is used but will never be tested as we always use guard so nothing to talk about itin short its up to you you want it or pass on
2,"Not a good phone i donot know why it is hypedI should have purchased moto g30 ir waited for HuwaeiProblems:1.camera is not good2. Volume automatically decrease and increase3. App not opening have to clear cache each time4. no note pad while calling5.baterry is not good yesterday level of battery of 51 % today when i woke i found my phone switch off6.fingerprint scan is not good compared to Honor7.heating problem in general use8.screen timeout when you are watching anything or reading anythingLook wise it is good,  connectivity is good"

1,Pls don't buy mi is just faking the specs pathetic phone not expected from a 14k phone camera is worse they've written 48mp rear and 13 mp front but my 5mp  old phone's camera  performance is better than this cheap quality a big no! Why fooling people degrading quality with every new note series
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
5,"If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 üåü):Processor ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êDisplay ‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êBattery ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in loud ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in 3.5 mm cord ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Selfie ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Back ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êNetworking ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êLack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."
3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
1,"Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
1,Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap
3,Made in China product
1,1. Very bad quality mobile2. Poor display quality(looks very cheap)3. Sound is very low4. Cmaera is like 2mp camera5. Performance is very slow(lag while using phone)6. Will get better mobiles with this price.7. Think 100 times before wasting your money on crap8. No pros at all
3,No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
4,Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
3,"This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
3,"Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery
5,"Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
2,Phone is good. But it is made in China
4,"Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
5,Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
1,"I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
3,"Purchased the 3gb variant of redmi 9a. Following is the review based on 1day of usageProsDisplay and battery backupOuter designLatest Android 10 based miui 12Back cover looks sturdy (less chances of falling off your hand)ConsPolycarbonate back cover vibrates when phone is on full volumeNo fast charging, takes 2 hr 45 minutes to fully chargeNo notification light (a big bummer)No Gorilla glass protectionNo fingerprint sensor however face unlock works fineVerdictA decent entry level phone however no need to exchange if u r using redmi 8a. If you can squeeze in a few more bucks, then there are many good phone for 9k."
5,Wow
4,"This phone is only good for parents who are using whatsapp, facebook, youtube, calling, etc...*Camera is average. You get average photos on day time.*Ram management is very bad. You can only run upto 2apps simultaneously üòî*go for only 3gb ram variant.*miui is good but some glitch some time.*do not expect huge gaming(maximum temple run level games)*in the lock scrern glance for mi is irritating.*battery is the plus point. For parents it last upto 1 weak. (Minimum use)*display is good.*front cam is also good. Good clariry while video calling.*no fast charging.*single speaker performs well.My personal suggession I bought it for me first but its not suitable me so i gave it to my father üòÇhe is very happy with itüòä"
4,"So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
1,"Open cheating by Realme.C11(2021) is rebranded as Narzo 50i.Every thing is same except back cover design.We can see model name as 'C11 2021' in 'about phone' setting of Narzo 50i.Worst part is we can get 'C11 2021' at Rs.900/- less than 'Narzo 50i'.Didn't expect this from Realme.Specifications on Amazon show it is a usb c-type cable, but cable is micro-usb."
1,I really disappointed with this product
1,not a good phone. Poor performance . Even it says Realme C11 at some place. Seems faulty phone
4,"I think I am the first buyer and this is first review of this product. üòÑI got it for 6299 Rs in big billion sale.For the price, it's display is bright and good quality. It has type C port which is exciting.(i found out later that it's not type c) 5000 mah battery. 18 W charging. Processor is good for mid graphics games like hill climb racing and few shooting games. It can play pubg but you won't enjoy it much. It can handle day to day apps like Whatsapp, facebook, instagram, chrome, youtube without any lag or heating. Camera is average but for this price it's good. Clickable pictures.It has realme ui which is features loaded. Best UI. I have 3 realme phones and updates are never delayed. Hence company really backup product after sales.Don't expect performance of a 10k or 15k phone. Compare it with realme C11 or redmi9a.Product description mentioned type C charger. That's really misleading. Really bad Marketing.1 star deducted.And yes Mint green is best color. ‚úåÔ∏è"
5,My phone not real which my order is realme narzo 50I but I check in this phone setting about phone realme c11
3,"Even in Settings ---> About phone ---> Device name,  it was mentioned as ""realme c11 2021"" . Ughhh... Atleast you guys should have changed that...."
2,AGAIN NO CASE IN REPLACED PHONE AS ADVERTISED IN THE AMAZON SITE. PLEASE CLARIFY WHEN DO WE GET THE CASE. ALSO THE PHONE MAY BE DEFECTIVE BECAUSE THE SIM TRAY IS NOT OPENING. WHY SO CARELESS WHEN SENDING PHONES TO THE CUSTOMER THAT AFTER FIRST COMPLAINT / REPLACEMENT. GET BACK TO US IMMEDIATELY WITH CLARIFICATION OR SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE.
5,Writing this review after using this product for more than 10 days overall experience is good with this product  as per price.Positive points mentioned here :-1:-camera quality is good enough2:- Picture pixel are good3:-Screen size is quite good4:- battery life is good5 :- Overall phone handling experience is good.Negative some issues with this product as mentioned here :-1:- Slow charging ( take more than 2 hours from 0% to 100%)2:- Back speaker quality is not so good3 :- Heating issue while charging the product4:- lagging issue sometime with multiple applications opening.
1,Misleading information by Amazon. Worst of the mobile by Realme.. Sound Jack broken in One week.. Type C cable written by Amazon but actual cable is Micro USB..
1,"Wrost mobile, Better guys you buy redmi 9, better than this realme"
1,No C type connector as mentioned in description. Poor quality Camera. Screen guard and Back Cover missing from what's mentioned
2,Battery life is not good.5000 mah battery must go atleast 24 hrs in normal use. It drain fast.Camera is worst... If you are looking for camera just don't buy this. Go for Narzo 50A is better.Screen is normal.Overall 3 star
1,"Display scratches on my mobile, am not satisfied in this product, very worst product"
1,I wanted to replace from the very first day of receiving the mobile due to minor display flickering problem but Amazon didn't give replacement option at all till the last date of replacement .I am forced to use as it is now.Very much disappointed ....!
1,Very bad choice very slow. os bhe slow hai type c port  brake type B prt deya hai fm bhe nahe hai I m a big fan of realme but is mobile ne to realme pe se vishwas he khatam kar deya don't buyAmezon delivery boy alos very rude
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
3,Camera quality is low
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.

1,The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang
1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"

1,It is the worst phone I have ever seen waste of money.Who is thinking to buy it do not.
2,"Please be aware that this is a downgraded version of globally launched Mi 11 and Mi 11 pro.Reason for low rating -1. Ordinary display. This is not the 2K display as featured on global versions of Mi 11 series2. No gorilla glass victus unlike global version.3. Band tests shows poor build quality which may result in breakage of phone due to bending4. Such a cheap tactic of selling a phone with the promise of fast charging and not providing charger with a adequate charging capacity.5. No curved display unlike global version.6. Took almost 20 days to get my hands on the phone post order.7. Reported heating issues in SD 888 while playing intensive gamesIn short, xiaomi has attempted to sell big story by first launching Mi 11 globally and then putting ""X"" and selling subpar product in India through illusion.I guess, Xiaomi should not have cut the corners and compromise the quality in Indian versions. Indians are willing to pay premium and success of oneplus is the testament to that. Any cunning move to undercut the value proposition will hurt xiaomi in long run.(note that I currently use redmi note 20 pro and have used so many phones of xiaomi ever since it launched first ever phone in India and hence hold a adequate credentials to voice my criticism as a fan)"
5,"What a Smartphone by Xiaomi! I am thoroughly impressed. I was using One Plus earlier but now One Plus doesn't stand a chance.  No one is giving you Snapdragon 888 process at this killer price, so just go for this.Display is gorgeous and just unbeatable. Even Samsung Galaxy S21+ is no match in display. Latest E4 Amoled is magical ‚Äì vivid colors, 1300 nits brightness, and 120Hz sampling refresh. You won't even notice such a small front camera punch hole.Camera is best in class. Time freeze motion mode, Telemacro and clone mode are just amazing features.Overall device feel so premium in hand thanks of top in class glass, ceramic and metal body."
4,"Received my Mi 11x Pro todayüòª . Really excited . Came with a  power adapter, usb cable,clear case ,type c to 3.5 mm converter and everything that is given in the what's in the box.My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. üòÖ One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth ü§§ It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best ü§û"
1,Worst mobile even wastage of money if it's price becomes 10000
5,"I love gaming and have been waiting for a SDM 888 under 40k which does not compromise on any aspect, and now i finally have it in my hands and its a Gaming Beast.The 360 Hz touch sampling rate makes up for buttery smooth game control. For all mobile gamers, pls have a look at the touch sampling rate as that determines more your response times, even more than screen refresh rate (not that Mi 11X pro lacks there with its vibrant 120 Hz OLED Panel).Camera Again, since I love making travel videos, and have been using an iPhone 11 for the past one year, this has been a welcome change, with its saturated and punchy images and videos that are a treat to the eye. For vlogs in outdoor scenarios, audio used to become an issue, however audio zoom  feature really helps reduce background noise and focus on the subject. No need to carry a separate mic!I have always liked soft bright colors on my gadgets and so chose the celestial silver one. Considering the hardware it packs the phone is surprisingly light and slim.As for the user interface which is MIUI, this phone has the cleanest version of MIUI yet. However being a nerd, I never shy away from the plethora of custom ROMs that popular Xiaomi devices get over at XDA, and this I am sure is going to be a blockbuster one, just like the K20 Pro from the past!! SO that's something up to try in the future!!"
3,"I am a oneplus 5 user for the last 4 years. So I can only compare it with Oneplus 5. Mi 11X pro is having one of the worst front cameras. The output is too artificial. In terms of processor, it's good, but you should think twice if you are looking for a mobile with a good camera."
2,"Definitely not the top tier phone yet impressed.Love the design. Snapdragon 888 has loads of raw processing power. Wifi 6 support is what I loved. 108mp camera shots are way below average.Cons:-Hate the slow data transfer usb 2.0 port-Slow 55 minute charging.(33w Sonic charger)-Miui Bloatware (getapps, Xiaomi ads, Tencent trackers) are a hassle can be removed using debloater tool from PC.-NightMode is horrible.-Overheating issue, hopefully should be fixed with MIUI 12.5 update in coming months.-if camera is your priority, choose a better device.Post MIUI 12.5.1 : pretty useless update, buggy as usual. Bloatware still exists. Not at all impressed. Not at all recommended to anyone.6 months later update (October 2021)This is clearly the worst device I have used. Presently given this phone to my watchman for his daily use. I got my OnePlus 7 pro broken screen repaired & instantly got that fluidic wow feel. Oxygen OS is lightyears ahead of MIUI.This phone is clearly made for MIUI users who doesn't have any clear knowledge about other UIs wanting to upgrade there phone."
5,"One of the best phones from Xiaomi, display is outstanding, camera, chipset are all the best you can get at this price, in-display fingerprint scanner is missing but trust me, side mounted scanner is more fast than u expect, this time Xiaomi has killed OnePlus in all ways possible, and also must say that the UI is much more clean and Im really enjoying the new software teweks..üòäLast but not least Super wallpapers in amoled display looks insanely amazing"
5,"Loved theCrisp screenSnappy processorUFS storage speedGames turbo modeCamera - awesome after tweaksDidn't like the Mi bloatware, but can be removed. Overall, a great package deal. Feels like a flagship, works like a flagship"
4,I have used iq007 legend for a week and returned it. luckily i got refund and purchased this mi 11x pro. I  generally play pubg at least 2 hours a day in HDR+EXTREME but I didn't find that much heat and frame drops in mi 11X pro but iq007 legend produced some heat and observed frame drops.  battery drop is equally more after gamming in both the devices and 33watts will be a draw back for mi11x.camera is very discouraging. details are very bad even with 108MP mode but 108MP camera in mi10 5g produced sharp detailed 108MP images. not satisfied with mi11x pro cameras.
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"Such an wonderful phone , everything is fast, wonderful display and feature packed"
1,"Today received my order, as of now it is excellent.Took long time for delivery due to order prioritization.Review CorrectionAfter usage of 2 months i'm correcting my reviewIt's Worst Mobile - loss of valuable moneyLot of Software BugsNo Proximity Sensor - experienced lot of problems while making callsSide button finger print is not so great idea, it makes us more irritateim suffering a lot now for buying this mobilePlease don't go for it, even tho if you want to buy thats your Karma."
5,"This is my first Xiaomi device, switching from One Plus . I generally do not tend to change devices frequently, so before buying I make sure that I know what I am getting into.Why I considered this device?Wanted the flagship processor, a good display with high refresh rate and dual speakers as I consume a lot of OTT content, 5G support to make the device future ready and a slim phone profile.YaysReally good performance, day to day multitasking is a cakewalk thanks to SD 888 processorHigh touch sampling rate provides an edge while gaming, controls feel much more responsiveDisplay is really bright and vivid. The colour reproduction is unparalleled.  This display can give the flagships a run for their money, may be even beat them.Camera captures crisp and detailed images, colours are tuned perfectly (something which even OP has not been able to fix). Really loved the Magic Zoom, Slow Shutter and the Freeze frame modes.I had been a bit skeptical on the UI because MIUI has a history of pushing bloatwares and ads. It came to me as a surprise that there are no ads or bloatwares. Really enjoyed the feature rich and highly customizable MIUI.A vertical camera setup, Gorilla Glass back and slim footprint makes the device feel really premium. I really loved the back panel and how the colour changes when viewed from different angles.NaysNot a fan of punch hole display but Mi 11X Pro seems to have the smallest punch-hole I have ever seen on any other phone."
4,I got the product on time. Phone camera quality is very good and faster processing and charging are added benefits. I was able to charge my phone to 100% in leee than one hour. And it took 9 hours to discharge my phone to 1% while using hotspot and streaming high quality videos at the same time.
1,"The Mi 11 Pro 5G that I received exactly a month ago has a lot of flaws. Please find them below.1. The Internet connection is frequently interrupted. The doggie picture above shows the error message that appears. The interruption is for a minute or 2, and the internet connection comes back.2. The power cable connects loosely to the mobile. Even though I connect the power cable as tightly and securely as I can to the mobile, and leave it for charging, the cable is hanging loose when I return to check whether the mobile has charged fully.3. During charging, a message often appears saying that the charging is slow. The electrician  has confirmed that there is no problem with my plug point. So the slow charge problem is only with the mobile.4. The sound from the receiver, when I answer a call, is feeble. I can just about hear the voice of the person at the other end. The volume is low, and I have to strain my ears.After having paid Rs 40,000, this is NOT ACCEPTABLE, where even basic services are defective. This is supposed to be a flagship product, and immediate attention to these problems is required."
5,"I'm writing this review after using the phone for a fortnight. I will breakdown my review in terms of Pros and Cons:PROS:- Best AMOLED screen in the market. The display is of the greatest quality. From colour saturation to brightness, everything is crisp and clear.- Celestial silver looks really premium.- Side mounted fingerprint sensors are REALLY FAST. The phone unlocks in a jiffy. Face unlock also works really well.- Camera is above average, if not the best. The 104MP rear camera takes stunning images and the picture quality is superb. Xiaomi has provided some great camera features like Vlog modes which is really fantastic. Videos shot in 4K & 8K are really good.- Speaker & sound quality is THE BEST. Love it.- WiFi & network reception are working better than expected. Supports WiFi calling, which is really helpful.- Processor is FAST. RAM management is really good.- Battery life is above average.CONS:- Not a fan of Google dialer & messaging app. MI dialer & messaging apps were FAR BETTER.- Proximity sensors are not working to the best of their capabilities. I hope they fix it with an update.- Front camera is average, if you take selfies.Overall I love this phone. I won't be wrong to say that this is the best phone in the market, at this price range. In fact it can knock down some other phones which costs 60/65k, I hope you understand my hint ;)."
5,"Overall KICKASS device, but some of my favourite features -- Display - simply gorgeous!, those colours - so vibrant, and so butter smooth- Processing speed - super fast - easily able to multi task.- Camera - some awesome UI optimizations - my favourite is the time freeze motion mode. The telemacro is just dope!- Very clean UI - no bloatware- This phone just feels right to hold! great hand feel.- I thought Audio zoom was a gimmick, but that actually works. Great job Xiaomi!"
5,"I came to buy One Plus 9 in this portal and Found a phone which is configuration wise much better than than my previous choice . I chose to save 10K with no compromise on the product .Now the question is what are the additional benefits I got even after saving 10K ?1. Got a Bigger and much better display 6.67‚Äù Vs 6.55‚Äù ,2. Much Brighter 1300 Vs 1100 , P2i coating to support water and resistant ,3. Also liquid cooling with better refresh rate as during lockdown I keep playing games so these two features was necessary . Also I know Battle Ground Indian version is coming .Now these were only feature wise benefits . But the experience was even better got the delivery on 14th so for last 4 days includes the long Eid Weekend I kept playing games and watching Netflix .Got no heating issue , battery is too good , and screen is much better and bigger ‚Ä¶ Finally I have bought another Redmi 9 Power , with 10K which I saved ÔÅä for my niece‚Äôs online class üòÄ"
1,AMOLED is worst.Lot of bugs in dark mode.Interface hangs slot.9pro is much better than this model.
1,"Paid 42k for mobile but it is not even value of 10k, Problem with every aspect of mobile,Replaced but no luck most of the issues are still there,Worst Back camera - It clicks pictures as Dark Oily face even how fair you areWorst Front camera - Clicks noisy picture in daylight also, any 10k mobile front camera is better than thisPoor Battery Backup - You'll get 10-12 hours of battery life even if you don't play any game3rd Class Screen - Screen Blinking issue and Green tint issue in dark room and screen always have warm coloursDon't fool yourself by buying this and stay away from amazons trap of extra bank discount and extra exchange offer.Amazon have worst return policy they don't care about customer,only replacement will be provided even if it has fault in model only, how many times you will return,Stay away from this mobile Save your time and Money."
5,"I got the phone delivered even with lockdown in the city, thank you Amazon!i am happy with the device. The DIsplay, Camera, PHOTOS, speed - everything is just perfect.For me DISPLAY is most important - we stare at the device all day.This is probably the best display I have seen in premiurm range phones. I think E4+ Amo led and Display Mate tech is helping.Other important things are camera and speed. It has a gorgeous camera - no complains only. The device is very fast, using non stop for last few days.Other than that -It Feels sturdy and the OS is quite clean, smooth.Couldn't find an cons as such... will update if I find something.Overall: It your budget is in 40k range - don't think, just go for this device - you will be happy!"
2,Lot many people suggested me to buy ONE PLUS 9R instead of this phone. But I previously had REDMI NOTE 8 PRO...which delivered quite good performance. Which is why I again opted for REDMI...and my expectations were quite high. TBH I don't feel spending 40000 on this phone is worth it.... selfie camera is pathetic... Ya rear camera is good but the performance is also okay okay not too good. I chose this phone over 9R only bcz of 888 processor.But the thing that disappointed me the most was there were issues in touch. And the most horrifying thing was the places of issues changed day to day. Initially I was having issues in upper part of the screen...after a day it was perfectly fine but then lower part of the screen was not responding well. So I put in a replacement request.Today I received my replacement phone and I am just hoping that I don't face touch issues in this one too. Otherwise I will literally regret buying this phone and that too when everyone was suggesting One plus 9R.I received my replacement phone which was having the same issues so I finally put in return request. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY MI PHONE. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
1,The phone is fast but the battery is not working properlyGuys try to buy a better phone than this but don‚Äôt do it Because of the battery problem
1,"Network issue during calling, call mute frequently happened, 33w charing took along time to full charge, battery heating issue. UI bugs are there, proximity sensor not working properly.."
1,"Its almost 1 month usage , i really feel bad with this mobile . Seriously waste of money if anyone interested with this mobile please please don't buy this mobile and don't buy it waste of money lot if bugs problem lottt of OS issue , camera clarity like crayon drawing ü§¢ dont dont dont buy this better try another product like vivo X series or OnePlus series , dont buy this"
5,"After watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of articles online, I finally decided to try out this phone. After using it for a week, I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. Listing down a couple of things that really impressed due to the price point for this phone:Loved the glossy black colour. Looks beautiful and very premium. The phone felt really good to hold in my hands, being super light and thin.The display was exceptionally bright, and I could really feel the colours coming alive while watching Netflix. I‚Äôm not a fan of the selfie camera in the display, but this punch hole camera was quite unobtrusive while watching movies and playing games. I really liked this.I play AoV on my phone, and was quite impressed with the smooth display and the fact that the phone was not heating up after playing for more than an hour. I guess I have the 888 processor to thank for this. Not sure if any other phone at this price offers this one.Last, but not the least, the camera here is quite good. I usually don‚Äôt experiment with different settings, and just use all default settings. Even then, the images produced were stunning. I did a quick comparison with people in my family (who use apple and oneplus) and really liked the way the colours were balanced in the photos from my camera. The level of detailing that this camera can capture is also very high.With all my office work, social media, watching youtube, movies etc.. the phone usually lasts me for 1.5 days after a single charge.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a power packed device at an affordable price. Totally worth the money."
5,Super phone with all flagship level specsEspecially performance was beast with low costThanks mi
5,"Will write detailed review later but here is my opinion, if you're confused between iqoo 7 legend, oneplus 9r & Mi 11x Pro go for Mi 11x pro considering all round performance.-Good in Camera-Performance is silky smooth-UI is very much improved MIUI 12-Android 11-Not much of a bloatware issue-Amazing Stereo speakers (Dolby Atom)-Gaming is amazing as it has flagship SD888-Not much of a heating issues as compared to previous flagship (will heat after heavy processor usage & it's normal cuz it have SD888)I would say that if you're buying a phone just for a single purpose i.e. gaming go for iqoo 7 legend it's best in class flagship processor. But Mi 11x Pro for all round usage."
1,"I just bought the phone and it keeps restarting whenever I turn on the Hotspot !! I don't know whether its a software problem or any other. I replaced and the same problem persists. Furthermore camera quality is horrible, they say that it's 108 MP but detailing is horrible. The normal UHD photography is also bad. Whenever you zoom in the picture distort. But the sound quality is extremely good. Battery backup is average."
5,"The Mi 11 X Pro is beautiful phone which has everything above the cut.Starting with display, being the only phone with a A+ certification is amazing, the E4 AMOLED on this is quite bright for a phone, have used a phone with such high brightness till date. Very distinct even under direct sunlight. Content watching on this phone is exceptionally good and playing games on 120Hz is a tootally different experience.Next comes the camera, the camera setup is too good, the pictures are not only near perfect on the phone but also when you use the image on your computer. The dynamic range of the phots are really good. Tried a bit of video recording and was amazed by the quality of the video recording, the time freeze motion and the audio zoom work well. By far one of the best camera's I have used on a Xiaomi phone.I was not so sure about MIUI but it seems to have become way better, there are few cool features which I can never let go but its been a pleasant experience so far, looks like Xiaomi has finally woke up to improve their software experience. The overall experience is snappy, Snapdragon 888 being the best of the best the performance matches to it, everything just works as expected.Combining all of these in a light weight yet durable form factor is a amazing."
4,Overall an excellent phone with everything power packed. Just the issue that i found was of battery draining fast. I hope an update from Xiaomi will solve this and further optimize it.
5,It is the best phone and truly a flagship at a very reasonable price.  Samsung/Oneplus: you are are looting people just due to your brand name.  Xiaomi is giving best features at best price.Please ignore the cons as mentioned in many of the views as it is a perfect phone as on date.  Everything about the phone is too nice and you will have good feeling of holding a true flagship mobile in your hand.You will not regret buying this phone rather will feel that it is truly a value for money mobile.Keep it up Xiaomi !!!  Very Beautiful Smartphone !!
4,"Writing this review after using the phone for last 7 daysFirst of all, the display is superb, phone is also nice and easy to hold onto hand and lightweightIt's very fast with SD 888 and 8GB RAM, silky smooth for day to day work and gaming (gets hot after 10 mins or so)Back camera is awesome, pro feature and videos are really cool. UWD camera is pedestrian thoughBattery, drains really fast, not sure why. Forget about 120HZ refresh rate, even with 60HZ and with normal use (no game!!), phone had to be charged within the day. I found that with 60HZ, dark mode and battery saver on, phone lasts a day without charging. This is a bit disappointingNext comes the software, MIUI needs improvement. Found strange issues like error popup during first time set up. It also starts to misbehave (like touch does not work properly, or hangs sometime) after 1-2 days of use and had to restart to get over it. I hope fixes will come soon for thisOverall I still feel it is a great value for money, if software is fixed, then other than battery, phone really becomes a flagship killer!"
1,Don't buy ... because cemera is totally bad ..not working properly... Hitting issues .
5,Display.  10/10Connectivity.  10/10New features.  10/10Smooth ness .  10/10Battery.  5/10.Better than one plus phone & samsungNumber one premium phone.Cons:Improve battery . Fast draining battery.
1,I have been a customer of Mi since 2016 and used to buy only Mi Phones for last 5 years. However this was the worst experience that I ever had with Mi.Bought this product as a part of Amazon Prime Day Sale and I was very disappointed. The set up was smooth but the problem started once I started charging it. It heated up so badly and the fingers had a warm sensation when I tried touching the screen. The refresh rate is very poor and this doesn't give the sense of being a very high quality expensive smart phone like this.Camera is average and the photo quality is the same as when compared to earlier Mi Phones of lower price.The default messaging app is hanging and I could not retrieve OTP Messages or my earlier messages as well.I raised a refund request with Amazon within 3 days that they accepted and bought Vivo X 60 Pro for same budget. Even though there is only replacement as a part of policy Amazon gave refund as there was no stock.Would have given separate rating of 5 for Amazon if there was a provision.Bye bye Mi. Won't come back again.
1,"1. Front camera shows foggy borders while on video calls2. Can not use Alexa and Google assistant on hands free enabled same time. Only default assistant will be available on hands free mode. (Degradation issue)3. Calls goes to hold after sometimes4. Too much expensive and hardware rich phone lacks by poor software5. Microphone do not work for calls, need to put on aeroplane mode and then call is possible.6. Both camera clearity is worst than redmi note 8 pro.7. While calling whole screen goes black irrespective of you touch phone to ear or not, then power button also not able to turn diaplay on. This is so much frustrating when you need to on speaker phone, 40k phone not providing flawless basic calling experience.8. Many smartphones under 20k, are better than this disaster"
5,"Writing a review after using the phone for 24 hours.Looks - This can be subjective but I love the celestial silver colour. Changes colours as light hits it. Look at pictures in my review. Bezels are thin and the phone is light weight.Display - This is my first phone with an Amoled display and boy what a world of difference. I compared it next to an Iphone 11 which has an IPS LCD panel and this display is so much better.Performance - Very snappy. No stutters in day to day usage. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on gaming performance.Camera - Very Nice. I paid extra for the 108MP sensor as compared to Mi 11X. Looks like it was worth it.Battery - Average. Normal usage got me an SOT of 5.5 hours, which is not bad and not great either.All in all very good value and in my opinion much better than OP 9R."
5,I needed a really good phone as a second device to help me with recording videos along with my mi 10. This more than satisfies the requirement. What I liked most :Camera - images come out clean with the right saturation. Some cool modes like the clone mode are fun to use with kids around the house. Great for shooting my pet dog!Display - super bright and very clean visuals. Don't know the tech terms but looks phenomenal. Think the 120 Hz refresh rate is a bit of game changer.Performance - Haven't seen any lag on any of the applications I've run including heavy shooters or video editing short clips of my dog for YouTube.Design - black is my preferred color after having lived with light colored phones ...this feels cleaner to hold. Comfortable to hold and carry despite the largeish battery.Overall a great phone and at this price it's a no brainer. Miui is also optimized for performance and has a simpler interface. Love it so far.
5,"Writing this comment after using 1 week.Amazing phone, best phone for this range, Nice camera, processor is also very fast, premium look‚Ä¶.best part is, this is 100% desi company whose manufacturing is also done in India.So, if you want a good phone within this range then go for it and also do support our Indian company #ProudlyIndian"

1,Worst Phone I have seen specs amd buyed it but not satisfied I have samsung m21 mobile which has amoled screen and always on display same they mentioned in this Redmi Note 10s but display clarity is worst than LCD and always on display stays only for 10 sec  .Worst Camera Performnace wise ok Didnt liked this phone and dont trap for technical gimmiks.
3,"All is well but photo quality is very bad. Note 7,9 series is better than note 10s. It's camera need to work on it. It is not capture the details of the photo like previous model of redmi. 48mp camera of Redmi note 9 is very very good than 64mp camera of Redmi note 10s"
4,Good
4,"Phone is tooo good.Battery life is for 15-20 days.Paise toh maine girlfriend se udhar liye hai, wo toh bol rahe hai ki lautane ki jarurat nai hai. Par uss pagli ko ye nai pata ki main sach mein dene wala nai hu.Phone toh mere biwi se bhi halka hai.Baaki camera thoda aur acha hona chaiye tha, wo kya hai na mera ek kaala dost hai uske photo ke liye sarre filter laga ke dekhe, par wo bechara abhi bhi kaala aata hai.Baaki sab mast hai."
1,"I ordered this phone, Redmi note 10s has network signal problem. the voice will break always. I contacted the customer support, i had bought this using 10% off. they are not replacing the phone and asking me to order the phone which is at higher price now. they are saying you can give the review whereever you want. they dont even care about the customer. dont order this product. its waste of money"
1,Don't buy. First ever Redmi product and it's disappointing. Screen doesn't light up when someone calls. (Check attached picture).Fingerprint scanner takes ages and many attempts to respond.Front camera is one of the worst that I have seen in recent times.I don't understand how come such a big company can release a product without proper R&D.
1,Camera quality is very Poor and Display it was saying that Super AMOLED display but it was not worth for it
5,"It's simply superb don't trust any other comments do trust my comment and its genuine comment ,in this price it's best best phone I ever seen"
5,"Pros:1. Solid build quality.2. Excellent display. Super Amoled quality is actually good.3. Perfect size - both weight and dimensions. Fits in hand perfectly.4. Loud speaker.5. Fast and lag free operation with 6/128 GB memory. Helio G95 is good processor.6. Adequate battery.7. Very good fingerprint sensor.Cons:1. Fast charging is not that fast. 2. Camera. It is not bad, but not excellent either. However, for the price, it may not be a bad one though.I needed a less expensive compact phone with reasonably good processor. It fits the bill perfectly. It feels comfortable to hold, carry and use. There should be more such phones with better specs."
1,"I purchased this mobile on 24th April with in 2 days i returned this mobile because i had a issue with hearing the opposite person voice. and received a replacement 11th June on that phone i had camera issue.When i open the camera it will automatically get closed and came to back to home screen hence i again returned. Now they said they will refund the amount. This is totally un acceptable.Never expected such a poor service from Amazon and never expected these issues in Redmi mobiles really very much disappointed.Friends, please don't go for this model its my humble request, Thanks"
1,No any front light (indicator) for charging miss call or massage battery life not good medium use one day life back side is  vary slippy display is ok ok
2,This phone doesn't have automatic call Recorder and when I Record call manually its loudly announce  your call has been recording  I tried many applications for recording but I'm unable to record call without announcements  so if anybody want to Record calls  so please don't buy thi mobileAnd also I purchased this mobile with no cost EMI but they are charged me 17%interest  its bad experience with Amazon
3,Google Play store not working. Took one whole day for all the apps and info to be downloaded and finally had to do it through GET APPS option of MI phone. Had to transfer data thru MI MOVER.FABULOUS camera.
1,I bought this phone there is a major problem in network issue I have already returne one phone they give me another one but like same I recommend it to everyone do not buy this  model üëç
1,Having problem with speakers in new redmi 10S phone which I purchased...  basic functionality calls not working properly at all - voice is not at all clear in between cut cut.... infact If we spend 1000 rupees & go for basic mobile  incoming & outgoing calls facility works awesome. But Redmi10S worst. Also the Redmi service center response is pathetic they are not approachable & do not accept the issue what we are facing even if we are coming up with proof. they say we have formatted software & no issue is found also they no replacement  & more over they don't even give any statement in writing verbally say no issue. We do get proof any proof for visiting Redmi service center. worst experience I faced spending 15K & buying Redmi 10S mobile. I suggest not to go for Redmi Mobile as I could see during my visit to service center many people visiting center with newly purchased mobile having one or the other issue... I will never ever suggest anybody to go for Redmi.
1,"Very owful experience first time with Amazon , Bought this for some one's gift but , Camera performance very poor in front camera and rear camera . It's latest vision and quality of Camera very poor don't know it's defective phone received or not !! and replacement is always not available and technician also not available I m very very desapointed with the service and product"
1,"Dear Sir / Madam,I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Mobile Phone and accessoriesThe issue that I have experienced was: I have booked a new mobile ( Redmi Note 10 S ) dated 9th-June-2021 from Amazon and received its delivery on dated 11th-June-2021, When i start using it, I faced a voice disturbance issue initially, I cross-checked my mobile network sim car by placing it in my old phone but there is no connectivity or network issue in my sim cardThen  I tried to reach Xiaomi via their website to customer care & emailed my issue but still, there is no such positive response from their side and still, I am facing such issue"
1,"Please try not to buy this model because I used all the models from Redmi. This is not at all working good.The first mobile after returning(due to Network and High Temperature issue) I got another 10S but this one too is a faulty one. apps hanging, camera not good , battery draining off quickly in stand by mode. I purchased this one by reading positive reviews but u will feel regret after buying this one. don't waste money try different model. always love amazon delivery speed and packing was not good for this product. Seller was also responsive. but fate mobile is a failure model."
5,Experience is going through. Almost good üòä
1,I got the phone delivered from amazon and charged it. Within 15 mins it overheated like an portable iron box. Then I requested for a refund but Amazon scheduled a technician visit then I got a replacement. It had the same issue. Now they issued a refund. The build quality of the phone is bad which is causing battery issues. I won‚Äôt recommend anyone buying this device.
5,"The phone is overall very impressive. After my first few days of basic usage, I can that it is smooth and fast with no lag. The camera is impressive in this price range. The UI is also nice and easy to use. Battery is good but not amazing. The sleek and lightweight build adds on to the value. On the whole I would say Redmi Note 10S is worth the penny.Review is based on first week of usage only."
1,"Very bad camera quality,Front camera-in night front camera is like vga camera,no details in picture.Back camera-in daylight if capture a photo no details is seen,if u zoom the image every part of the pic is blurrVideo camera -my previous realme u1 was far ahed of this that was only 13 mp camera.Front camera-1/5Back camera-1/5Video -1/5Processor is also bad pubg in smooth and ultra settings the phn is heating too tooo tooo much."
1,After 10 days of use i am sharing experience. Incoming Audio is not clearPhotos are not natural at allFinger touch westAutorotate sensor not at allworking. You need to do manually.West product. This should less than 7k
1,"I can't imagine that this is Redmi phone, I am using Redmi brand from last 6 years and this is my third mobile set of Redmi.I am not satisfied and even suggest to others, don't buy any redmi more then 10k and above, its not working well in most of the parameters, so only purchase les. Then 10k price Redmi mobile, don't go much higher.I am totally dissatisfied with my latest Redmi note 10 S, if MI company give me chance I will pay and purchase Redmi 10 pro...I would not prefer 10S.So be care....."
5,"I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera."
1,"I have compared the phone with a much lesser price Redmi note 10, In almost all factors the RMN10 is better. Am not a gaming person. Even using the camera the phone was heating. Am disappointed in buying this device. One of the worst phones I have bought from Redmi.  I have buying Redmi phones since 2015, till now I have bought 8 Redmi phones. This is the only phone was disappointed.Selfie camera in low light is pathetic.64 MB camera performers are inconsistent. Some pics are good"
4,"Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more"
1,Poor camera quality. Don't buy this product.I have used real me xt before and it's camera quality was awesome. But redmi has a very bad camera quality comparing to real me... Not worth of money.
5,"Ignore all the reviews, trust the Youtubers. Most of the negative reviews are from people who don't even know about tech.This is a worthy Phone even after months of release.Yes, there are better options from Realme but I don't like Realme's build quality and design."

4,"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve ‚Äî the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in ‚Äî the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricingüá©¬†üá™¬†üá∏¬†üáÆ¬†üá¨¬†üá≥¬†Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I‚Äôd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What‚Äôs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn‚Äôt strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.üá©¬†üáÆ¬†üá∏¬†üáµ¬†üá±¬†üá¶¬†üáæ¬†The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it‚Äôs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it‚Äôs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it‚Äôs just not bright enough.üÖ±üÖ∞üÜÉüÜÉüÖ¥üÜÅüÜàThe battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow ‚Äî the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?üÖ≤üÖ∞üÖºüÖ¥üÜÅüÖ∞There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There‚Äôs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps."
5,Awesome
1,"Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently"
5,Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
4,i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
1,This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
5,Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
4,Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price
5,Good mobile
5,Good product. Value for money phone. Everything is average. Display is good. Battery life is also good. I bought it for a employee of mine. Overall a good phone. 4/64 combo is hard to  find in this price range. Exceeded my expectations.
1,"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile."

1,"My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone."

3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
4,Overall good mobile...But Camera not good as expected.Overall Performance is good .Value For Money
2,I was having Samsung before same 4gb ram and battery back was very good but in redmi with out much of space or app ram speed is very very slow and battery back up draing with a day so not happy with the redmi product .I can return to Amazon with in 7 days but unfortunately our building is effected with covid possiitive so totally issulated no one should have contact with us so can't able to send the return mobile

2,"Cons :- Orange Back different from that shown in product pictures. Not attractive.- No battery charging indicator light.Once the mobile goes in sleep mode, you cannot figure if it is charging or not.- Defective Sound System : volume is generally low. No Bass At All. Sound Volume goes up and down on its own while playing songs/video.- Extremely Short (half meter) charging cable- Micro-USB B-type port- Outdated handset. Not worth the money.- No RETURN Option despite receiving defective piece- No Option to schedule technician visit before replacement window closes (all slots permanently full)Stuck with a defective handset.No scope of Return & purchasing another model.This feels like fraud.Disappointed with Amazon for the first time."
2,"Phone is only for Calling, Whats App and Youtube.I gifted this phone to my mother, so as per her usage i felt its okay.Worst part is camera.... I even had Redmi Note 4.... I seriously felt Note 4  camera is much better that redmi 9.I got this phone in 7500/-"
1,"If you ignore this review, you ll end up regretting. Camera quality of this phone is worse than you'd have ever had. If you click a selfie you'll look an old person. No color, no texture. You can say that it's a budget phone and all that. That's true but even a simple one megapixel camera has 100 times better camera. Not exaggerating.Battery also a bit weak. Don't buy"
1,Don't buy this phone
1,Front camara worrest
1,"Front camera is worst , I doubt does it really have a 50 MP Rear camera  ...after 2 days of using mobile , YouTube was not responding , and many such apps weren't responding named Music , Gallery etc"
1,"Firstly camera quality is not upto mark.Mobile get hang, while accessing any applications call applications will get disappear from the screen when mobile get hang.....don't buy this mobile phone this is  my personal suggestion."
2,disappointment from front camera performance below average very bad performance. and then everything is average
3,Front camera is not working properly. The image and video is blur.
1,Totally waste of money and camera quality is very bad and processer is not good
1,Sim slot is not working
2,"Please must read my review before u buying, now I am using redmi note 10 , I bought note 10 for 14k(6+128), it is great value for money, but redmi 10 prime cost is 12.5k (4+64)  which is very very high price according to its quality of features, front camera captures like 5mp, it is not an 8mp camera, even back camera 50 mp also captures washed out pictures, in the camera department completely utterflap redmi this time, charging time is very long because of battery 6000mah , display is not upto the mark but ok, sound output is good, only main speaker is loud and other is low sound, call quality ok, design good, I had used redmi note 8 before redmi note 10, it is the best value for money under 10k But now redmi 10 prime is not upto the mark for this price, please go to note 10 don't buy redmi 10 prime"
5,Nothing to dislike.. Everything good
5,"Posting review after 12 days if use.The phone is absolutely gorgeous! The body is plastic but the quality is not compromised. Tempered glass was already applied and the touch works with even a featherlight touch. Moving between apps is extremely fluid. I'm not much of a games, but the candy Crush works fine.The camera is beyond my expectation. Many reviews sat it's not good, but I found the picture quality and effects to be at par with sony camera.Only thing I don't like is the missing notification indicator. I miss important and urgent messages due to its absence. Apart from that, the best phone I've personally used!"
4,Front camera is not optimised and up to the mark back camera is not optimised.Performance is average . Display quality good.Sound quality superb. Bigger battery gives boosts . Some minor glitches that can be fixed afterwards through updates. Overall good for normal usage .
4,"Outstanding device.The phone design is so premium, but actually it's plastic body. The phone comes with amazing features and great processor in it's price range. In this budget segment I've used Samsung and Realme devices also. But, this Redmi 10 Prime is best among them.The only cons is that the camera is not upto the mark and if you're not regular Redmi phone user then you will have to modify lot of things in this device to make it handy."
4,Received phone today.. Quite nice phone. Need to learn how to take pictures with 50mb cam.. All good
1,"Its very simple, ""I shouldn't have bought this mobile"""
5,Excellent mobile phoneExcellent cameraGood battery lifeExcellent displayAll things are excellent in the mobile go for it ....
5,"Battery backup was nice. Yes it does take a bit longer to charge, but at least in my case that wasn't a problem.Camera was nice unlike the other comments I read before I bought the phone. There are some problems though. The fingerprint sensor is terrible. Sometimes it just wouldn't open (that happens rarely but it does happen) and I would have to put the pin manually.Design looks great, display looks great. I didn't face any brightness issues outdoors so no regret of buying it.The stereo speakers are just fine, and so far the phone never heated up after charging or game usage.It ticked all my boxes."
1,"Please don't buy these cheap and worst camera mobile. Company claims 1st 50 MP camera , which takes picture worse than 5 mp camera. Need explanation from Amazon for giving wrong information to customers and cheating with seller. I'll give -5 for camera quality"
1,Wrost phone plzz not buy waste of money camera quality is very bad only features showen highlightly but they or not according to as they are shown 50 mg camera like 13 megapixel selfie camera is wrost in light mode you feel camera is wrost dark photos are click
1,"So many issues with this model, I have used many mi phones but this is the fist time I have faced so many issues with this model, fist of all about camera, front camera is very poor clarity, 2nd is wifi signal strength receiving is also poor, so many lags in miui 12.5, contact & dailing Google app has so many issues, mi dailing & contact's was very good and user friendly why I don't know that was changed to Google app, I didn't like Google contact app and it has so many issues, and there are so many software issues in 12.5 update also. I am a big fan of mi products & after using this model I changed my mind & want to shift to other company. In that way the phone model has impacted me. Finally I sincere suggestion you don't buy this model if you are using this phone for video calls at least."

Packaging is good.About Redmi 10 Prime:Pros :Good screen size, Primary camera, battery backup as used for 3 days on first charge,body dimensions etcCons:Selfie camera 8 megapixel as in catalogue,but I disappointed in room light ,it gives a dull image. I have Asus Zenfone 3 Max having 5Mp gives a clear photo in selfie ü§≥ .  I have a 3 Star üåü ating  for the overall Mobile Phone, Fingerprint and Face unlock not set.Will review again after 3 months. Price can be reduced to 13000 for 6 GB 128 GB phone. As I got a feedback that phone is selling at same rate at local mobile shops, then why advertising best year offer.."
1,I bought this phone only coz it has 50mp camera but it's been a week I have using the phone and it's totally totally worst camera ever.. Any 10year old basic camera phone is better than this.Along time this even the performance is not great or would be usuable for any basic games..Pricing is too highOnly power backup is goodPlease don't buy this phone
5,Nice...thanq
4,"Call recording built-in feature is pathetic as user has to manually click on call record option for each call while the call is going on, then it notifies both caller and receiver saying this call is being recorded which really sounds awkward and the apps available in play store for auto call recording does not work....please don't buy this mobile if you need to auto record calls.Other than this rest of the features are as expected for this price range"
1,Don't wait for updates. Go for other models.Update won't change this product. Build quality not all good.We are fool already purchased. You guys aware of this.Only positive about this phone is battery.
2,All features is so good but camera is very poor
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
3,Camera quality is low
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.

1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
5,Recently only I got this Jiophone. The working of phone is good. But if you are purchasing for Whatsapp operating or any social media operating. This phone could not work out as memory is low to store.This Jiophone is good purchase only to save money on your SIM mobile number working.  Only Jio SIM works it. First time you have to recharge it by ‚Çπ149/- for activation. There after you can purchase ‚Çπ749/- plan special for Jiophone handset users. Unlimited calling for 336 days with 24GB data.

2,"Please be aware that this is a downgraded version of globally launched Mi 11 and Mi 11 pro.Reason for low rating -1. Ordinary display. This is not the 2K display as featured on global versions of Mi 11 series2. No gorilla glass victus unlike global version.3. Band tests shows poor build quality which may result in breakage of phone due to bending4. Such a cheap tactic of selling a phone with the promise of fast charging and not providing charger with a adequate charging capacity.5. No curved display unlike global version.6. Took almost 20 days to get my hands on the phone post order.7. Reported heating issues in SD 888 while playing intensive gamesIn short, xiaomi has attempted to sell big story by first launching Mi 11 globally and then putting ""X"" and selling subpar product in India through illusion.I guess, Xiaomi should not have cut the corners and compromise the quality in Indian versions. Indians are willing to pay premium and success of oneplus is the testament to that. Any cunning move to undercut the value proposition will hurt xiaomi in long run.(note that I currently use redmi note 20 pro and have used so many phones of xiaomi ever since it launched first ever phone in India and hence hold a adequate credentials to voice my criticism as a fan)"
5,"What a Smartphone by Xiaomi! I am thoroughly impressed. I was using One Plus earlier but now One Plus doesn't stand a chance.  No one is giving you Snapdragon 888 process at this killer price, so just go for this.Display is gorgeous and just unbeatable. Even Samsung Galaxy S21+ is no match in display. Latest E4 Amoled is magical ‚Äì vivid colors, 1300 nits brightness, and 120Hz sampling refresh. You won't even notice such a small front camera punch hole.Camera is best in class. Time freeze motion mode, Telemacro and clone mode are just amazing features.Overall device feel so premium in hand thanks of top in class glass, ceramic and metal body."
4,"Received my Mi 11x Pro todayüòª . Really excited . Came with a  power adapter, usb cable,clear case ,type c to 3.5 mm converter and everything that is given in the what's in the box.My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. üòÖ One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth ü§§ It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best ü§û"
1,Worst mobile even wastage of money if it's price becomes 10000
5,"I love gaming and have been waiting for a SDM 888 under 40k which does not compromise on any aspect, and now i finally have it in my hands and its a Gaming Beast.The 360 Hz touch sampling rate makes up for buttery smooth game control. For all mobile gamers, pls have a look at the touch sampling rate as that determines more your response times, even more than screen refresh rate (not that Mi 11X pro lacks there with its vibrant 120 Hz OLED Panel).Camera Again, since I love making travel videos, and have been using an iPhone 11 for the past one year, this has been a welcome change, with its saturated and punchy images and videos that are a treat to the eye. For vlogs in outdoor scenarios, audio used to become an issue, however audio zoom  feature really helps reduce background noise and focus on the subject. No need to carry a separate mic!I have always liked soft bright colors on my gadgets and so chose the celestial silver one. Considering the hardware it packs the phone is surprisingly light and slim.As for the user interface which is MIUI, this phone has the cleanest version of MIUI yet. However being a nerd, I never shy away from the plethora of custom ROMs that popular Xiaomi devices get over at XDA, and this I am sure is going to be a blockbuster one, just like the K20 Pro from the past!! SO that's something up to try in the future!!"
3,"I am a oneplus 5 user for the last 4 years. So I can only compare it with Oneplus 5. Mi 11X pro is having one of the worst front cameras. The output is too artificial. In terms of processor, it's good, but you should think twice if you are looking for a mobile with a good camera."
2,"Definitely not the top tier phone yet impressed.Love the design. Snapdragon 888 has loads of raw processing power. Wifi 6 support is what I loved. 108mp camera shots are way below average.Cons:-Hate the slow data transfer usb 2.0 port-Slow 55 minute charging.(33w Sonic charger)-Miui Bloatware (getapps, Xiaomi ads, Tencent trackers) are a hassle can be removed using debloater tool from PC.-NightMode is horrible.-Overheating issue, hopefully should be fixed with MIUI 12.5 update in coming months.-if camera is your priority, choose a better device.Post MIUI 12.5.1 : pretty useless update, buggy as usual. Bloatware still exists. Not at all impressed. Not at all recommended to anyone.6 months later update (October 2021)This is clearly the worst device I have used. Presently given this phone to my watchman for his daily use. I got my OnePlus 7 pro broken screen repaired & instantly got that fluidic wow feel. Oxygen OS is lightyears ahead of MIUI.This phone is clearly made for MIUI users who doesn't have any clear knowledge about other UIs wanting to upgrade there phone."
5,"One of the best phones from Xiaomi, display is outstanding, camera, chipset are all the best you can get at this price, in-display fingerprint scanner is missing but trust me, side mounted scanner is more fast than u expect, this time Xiaomi has killed OnePlus in all ways possible, and also must say that the UI is much more clean and Im really enjoying the new software teweks..üòäLast but not least Super wallpapers in amoled display looks insanely amazing"
5,"Loved theCrisp screenSnappy processorUFS storage speedGames turbo modeCamera - awesome after tweaksDidn't like the Mi bloatware, but can be removed. Overall, a great package deal. Feels like a flagship, works like a flagship"
4,I have used iq007 legend for a week and returned it. luckily i got refund and purchased this mi 11x pro. I  generally play pubg at least 2 hours a day in HDR+EXTREME but I didn't find that much heat and frame drops in mi 11X pro but iq007 legend produced some heat and observed frame drops.  battery drop is equally more after gamming in both the devices and 33watts will be a draw back for mi11x.camera is very discouraging. details are very bad even with 108MP mode but 108MP camera in mi10 5g produced sharp detailed 108MP images. not satisfied with mi11x pro cameras.
1,"Paid 42k for mobile but it is not even value of 10k, Problem with every aspect of mobile,Replaced but no luck most of the issues are still there,Worst Back camera - It clicks pictures as Dark Oily face even how fair you areWorst Front camera - Clicks noisy picture in daylight also, any 10k mobile front camera is better than thisPoor Battery Backup - You'll get 10-12 hours of battery life even if you don't play any game3rd Class Screen - Screen Blinking issue and Green tint issue in dark room and screen always have warm coloursDon't fool yourself by buying this and stay away from amazons trap of extra bank discount and extra exchange offer.Amazon have worst return policy they don't care about customer,only replacement will be provided even if it has fault in model only, how many times you will return,Stay away from this mobile Save your time and Money."
5,"I got the phone delivered even with lockdown in the city, thank you Amazon!i am happy with the device. The DIsplay, Camera, PHOTOS, speed - everything is just perfect.For me DISPLAY is most important - we stare at the device all day.This is probably the best display I have seen in premiurm range phones. I think E4+ Amo led and Display Mate tech is helping.Other important things are camera and speed. It has a gorgeous camera - no complains only. The device is very fast, using non stop for last few days.Other than that -It Feels sturdy and the OS is quite clean, smooth.Couldn't find an cons as such... will update if I find something.Overall: It your budget is in 40k range - don't think, just go for this device - you will be happy!"
2,Lot many people suggested me to buy ONE PLUS 9R instead of this phone. But I previously had REDMI NOTE 8 PRO...which delivered quite good performance. Which is why I again opted for REDMI...and my expectations were quite high. TBH I don't feel spending 40000 on this phone is worth it.... selfie camera is pathetic... Ya rear camera is good but the performance is also okay okay not too good. I chose this phone over 9R only bcz of 888 processor.But the thing that disappointed me the most was there were issues in touch. And the most horrifying thing was the places of issues changed day to day. Initially I was having issues in upper part of the screen...after a day it was perfectly fine but then lower part of the screen was not responding well. So I put in a replacement request.Today I received my replacement phone and I am just hoping that I don't face touch issues in this one too. Otherwise I will literally regret buying this phone and that too when everyone was suggesting One plus 9R.I received my replacement phone which was having the same issues so I finally put in return request. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY MI PHONE. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
1,The phone is fast but the battery is not working properlyGuys try to buy a better phone than this but don‚Äôt do it Because of the battery problem
1,"Network issue during calling, call mute frequently happened, 33w charing took along time to full charge, battery heating issue. UI bugs are there, proximity sensor not working properly.."
1,"Its almost 1 month usage , i really feel bad with this mobile . Seriously waste of money if anyone interested with this mobile please please don't buy this mobile and don't buy it waste of money lot if bugs problem lottt of OS issue , camera clarity like crayon drawing ü§¢ dont dont dont buy this better try another product like vivo X series or OnePlus series , dont buy this"
5,"After watching a lot of videos and reading a lot of articles online, I finally decided to try out this phone. After using it for a week, I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. Listing down a couple of things that really impressed due to the price point for this phone:Loved the glossy black colour. Looks beautiful and very premium. The phone felt really good to hold in my hands, being super light and thin.The display was exceptionally bright, and I could really feel the colours coming alive while watching Netflix. I‚Äôm not a fan of the selfie camera in the display, but this punch hole camera was quite unobtrusive while watching movies and playing games. I really liked this.I play AoV on my phone, and was quite impressed with the smooth display and the fact that the phone was not heating up after playing for more than an hour. I guess I have the 888 processor to thank for this. Not sure if any other phone at this price offers this one.Last, but not the least, the camera here is quite good. I usually don‚Äôt experiment with different settings, and just use all default settings. Even then, the images produced were stunning. I did a quick comparison with people in my family (who use apple and oneplus) and really liked the way the colours were balanced in the photos from my camera. The level of detailing that this camera can capture is also very high.With all my office work, social media, watching youtube, movies etc.. the phone usually lasts me for 1.5 days after a single charge.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a power packed device at an affordable price. Totally worth the money."
5,Super phone with all flagship level specsEspecially performance was beast with low costThanks mi
5,"Will write detailed review later but here is my opinion, if you're confused between iqoo 7 legend, oneplus 9r & Mi 11x Pro go for Mi 11x pro considering all round performance.-Good in Camera-Performance is silky smooth-UI is very much improved MIUI 12-Android 11-Not much of a bloatware issue-Amazing Stereo speakers (Dolby Atom)-Gaming is amazing as it has flagship SD888-Not much of a heating issues as compared to previous flagship (will heat after heavy processor usage & it's normal cuz it have SD888)I would say that if you're buying a phone just for a single purpose i.e. gaming go for iqoo 7 legend it's best in class flagship processor. But Mi 11x Pro for all round usage."
1,"I just bought the phone and it keeps restarting whenever I turn on the Hotspot !! I don't know whether its a software problem or any other. I replaced and the same problem persists. Furthermore camera quality is horrible, they say that it's 108 MP but detailing is horrible. The normal UHD photography is also bad. Whenever you zoom in the picture distort. But the sound quality is extremely good. Battery backup is average."
5,"The Mi 11 X Pro is beautiful phone which has everything above the cut.Starting with display, being the only phone with a A+ certification is amazing, the E4 AMOLED on this is quite bright for a phone, have used a phone with such high brightness till date. Very distinct even under direct sunlight. Content watching on this phone is exceptionally good and playing games on 120Hz is a tootally different experience.Next comes the camera, the camera setup is too good, the pictures are not only near perfect on the phone but also when you use the image on your computer. The dynamic range of the phots are really good. Tried a bit of video recording and was amazed by the quality of the video recording, the time freeze motion and the audio zoom work well. By far one of the best camera's I have used on a Xiaomi phone.I was not so sure about MIUI but it seems to have become way better, there are few cool features which I can never let go but its been a pleasant experience so far, looks like Xiaomi has finally woke up to improve their software experience. The overall experience is snappy, Snapdragon 888 being the best of the best the performance matches to it, everything just works as expected.Combining all of these in a light weight yet durable form factor is a amazing."
4,Overall an excellent phone with everything power packed. Just the issue that i found was of battery draining fast. I hope an update from Xiaomi will solve this and further optimize it.
5,It is the best phone and truly a flagship at a very reasonable price.  Samsung/Oneplus: you are are looting people just due to your brand name.  Xiaomi is giving best features at best price.Please ignore the cons as mentioned in many of the views as it is a perfect phone as on date.  Everything about the phone is too nice and you will have good feeling of holding a true flagship mobile in your hand.You will not regret buying this phone rather will feel that it is truly a value for money mobile.Keep it up Xiaomi !!!  Very Beautiful Smartphone !!
4,"Writing this review after using the phone for last 7 daysFirst of all, the display is superb, phone is also nice and easy to hold onto hand and lightweightIt's very fast with SD 888 and 8GB RAM, silky smooth for day to day work and gaming (gets hot after 10 mins or so)Back camera is awesome, pro feature and videos are really cool. UWD camera is pedestrian thoughBattery, drains really fast, not sure why. Forget about 120HZ refresh rate, even with 60HZ and with normal use (no game!!), phone had to be charged within the day. I found that with 60HZ, dark mode and battery saver on, phone lasts a day without charging. This is a bit disappointingNext comes the software, MIUI needs improvement. Found strange issues like error popup during first time set up. It also starts to misbehave (like touch does not work properly, or hangs sometime) after 1-2 days of use and had to restart to get over it. I hope fixes will come soon for thisOverall I still feel it is a great value for money, if software is fixed, then other than battery, phone really becomes a flagship killer!"
1,Don't buy ... because cemera is totally bad ..not working properly... Hitting issues .
5,Display.  10/10Connectivity.  10/10New features.  10/10Smooth ness .  10/10Battery.  5/10.Better than one plus phone & samsungNumber one premium phone.Cons:Improve battery . Fast draining battery.
1,I have been a customer of Mi since 2016 and used to buy only Mi Phones for last 5 years. However this was the worst experience that I ever had with Mi.Bought this product as a part of Amazon Prime Day Sale and I was very disappointed. The set up was smooth but the problem started once I started charging it. It heated up so badly and the fingers had a warm sensation when I tried touching the screen. The refresh rate is very poor and this doesn't give the sense of being a very high quality expensive smart phone like this.Camera is average and the photo quality is the same as when compared to earlier Mi Phones of lower price.The default messaging app is hanging and I could not retrieve OTP Messages or my earlier messages as well.I raised a refund request with Amazon within 3 days that they accepted and bought Vivo X 60 Pro for same budget. Even though there is only replacement as a part of policy Amazon gave refund as there was no stock.Would have given separate rating of 5 for Amazon if there was a provision.Bye bye Mi. Won't come back again.
1,"1. Front camera shows foggy borders while on video calls2. Can not use Alexa and Google assistant on hands free enabled same time. Only default assistant will be available on hands free mode. (Degradation issue)3. Calls goes to hold after sometimes4. Too much expensive and hardware rich phone lacks by poor software5. Microphone do not work for calls, need to put on aeroplane mode and then call is possible.6. Both camera clearity is worst than redmi note 8 pro.7. While calling whole screen goes black irrespective of you touch phone to ear or not, then power button also not able to turn diaplay on. This is so much frustrating when you need to on speaker phone, 40k phone not providing flawless basic calling experience.8. Many smartphones under 20k, are better than this disaster"
5,"Writing a review after using the phone for 24 hours.Looks - This can be subjective but I love the celestial silver colour. Changes colours as light hits it. Look at pictures in my review. Bezels are thin and the phone is light weight.Display - This is my first phone with an Amoled display and boy what a world of difference. I compared it next to an Iphone 11 which has an IPS LCD panel and this display is so much better.Performance - Very snappy. No stutters in day to day usage. I'm not a gamer so can't comment on gaming performance.Camera - Very Nice. I paid extra for the 108MP sensor as compared to Mi 11X. Looks like it was worth it.Battery - Average. Normal usage got me an SOT of 5.5 hours, which is not bad and not great either.All in all very good value and in my opinion much better than OP 9R."
5,I needed a really good phone as a second device to help me with recording videos along with my mi 10. This more than satisfies the requirement. What I liked most :Camera - images come out clean with the right saturation. Some cool modes like the clone mode are fun to use with kids around the house. Great for shooting my pet dog!Display - super bright and very clean visuals. Don't know the tech terms but looks phenomenal. Think the 120 Hz refresh rate is a bit of game changer.Performance - Haven't seen any lag on any of the applications I've run including heavy shooters or video editing short clips of my dog for YouTube.Design - black is my preferred color after having lived with light colored phones ...this feels cleaner to hold. Comfortable to hold and carry despite the largeish battery.Overall a great phone and at this price it's a no brainer. Miui is also optimized for performance and has a simpler interface. Love it so far.
5,"Writing this comment after using 1 week.Amazing phone, best phone for this range, Nice camera, processor is also very fast, premium look‚Ä¶.best part is, this is 100% desi company whose manufacturing is also done in India.So, if you want a good phone within this range then go for it and also do support our Indian company #ProudlyIndian"

2,"Please must read my review before u buying, now I am using redmi note 10 , I bought note 10 for 14k(6+128), it is great value for money, but redmi 10 prime cost is 12.5k (4+64)  which is very very high price according to its quality of features, front camera captures like 5mp, it is not an 8mp camera, even back camera 50 mp also captures washed out pictures, in the camera department completely utterflap redmi this time, charging time is very long because of battery 6000mah , display is not upto the mark but ok, sound output is good, only main speaker is loud and other is low sound, call quality ok, design good, I had used redmi note 8 before redmi note 10, it is the best value for money under 10k But now redmi 10 prime is not upto the mark for this price, please go to note 10 don't buy redmi 10 prime"
5,Nothing to dislike.. Everything good
5,"Posting review after 12 days if use.The phone is absolutely gorgeous! The body is plastic but the quality is not compromised. Tempered glass was already applied and the touch works with even a featherlight touch. Moving between apps is extremely fluid. I'm not much of a games, but the candy Crush works fine.The camera is beyond my expectation. Many reviews sat it's not good, but I found the picture quality and effects to be at par with sony camera.Only thing I don't like is the missing notification indicator. I miss important and urgent messages due to its absence. Apart from that, the best phone I've personally used!"
4,Front camera is not optimised and up to the mark back camera is not optimised.Performance is average . Display quality good.Sound quality superb. Bigger battery gives boosts . Some minor glitches that can be fixed afterwards through updates. Overall good for normal usage .
4,"Outstanding device.The phone design is so premium, but actually it's plastic body. The phone comes with amazing features and great processor in it's price range. In this budget segment I've used Samsung and Realme devices also. But, this Redmi 10 Prime is best among them.The only cons is that the camera is not upto the mark and if you're not regular Redmi phone user then you will have to modify lot of things in this device to make it handy."
4,Received phone today.. Quite nice phone. Need to learn how to take pictures with 50mb cam.. All good
1,"Its very simple, ""I shouldn't have bought this mobile"""
5,Excellent mobile phoneExcellent cameraGood battery lifeExcellent displayAll things are excellent in the mobile go for it ....
5,"Battery backup was nice. Yes it does take a bit longer to charge, but at least in my case that wasn't a problem.Camera was nice unlike the other comments I read before I bought the phone. There are some problems though. The fingerprint sensor is terrible. Sometimes it just wouldn't open (that happens rarely but it does happen) and I would have to put the pin manually.Design looks great, display looks great. I didn't face any brightness issues outdoors so no regret of buying it.The stereo speakers are just fine, and so far the phone never heated up after charging or game usage.It ticked all my boxes."
1,"Please don't buy these cheap and worst camera mobile. Company claims 1st 50 MP camera , which takes picture worse than 5 mp camera. Need explanation from Amazon for giving wrong information to customers and cheating with seller. I'll give -5 for camera quality"
1,Wrost phone plzz not buy waste of money camera quality is very bad only features showen highlightly but they or not according to as they are shown 50 mg camera like 13 megapixel selfie camera is wrost in light mode you feel camera is wrost dark photos are click
1,"So many issues with this model, I have used many mi phones but this is the fist time I have faced so many issues with this model, fist of all about camera, front camera is very poor clarity, 2nd is wifi signal strength receiving is also poor, so many lags in miui 12.5, contact & dailing Google app has so many issues, mi dailing & contact's was very good and user friendly why I don't know that was changed to Google app, I didn't like Google contact app and it has so many issues, and there are so many software issues in 12.5 update also. I am a big fan of mi products & after using this model I changed my mind & want to shift to other company. In that way the phone model has impacted me. Finally I sincere suggestion you don't buy this model if you are using this phone for video calls at least."
5,overall very nice product
5,Best in the market till nowPrevious I had a Note 7 pro that was too fabulousNow I own a 10 primeü§©ü§©ü§©
1,The camera stands out and is a bit better when compared with a VGA cam on a feature phone.
1,High price low quality
3,"I bought this Redmi 10 Prime during Great Indian Festival. Order received 4th October. Packaging is good.About Redmi 10 Prime:Pros :Good screen size, Primary camera, battery backup as used for 3 days on first charge,body dimensions etcCons:Selfie camera 8 megapixel as in catalogue,but I disappointed in room light ,it gives a dull image. I have Asus Zenfone 3 Max having 5Mp gives a clear photo in selfie ü§≥ .  I have a 3 Star üåü ating  for the overall Mobile Phone, Fingerprint and Face unlock not set.Will review again after 3 months. Price can be reduced to 13000 for 6 GB 128 GB phone. As I got a feedback that phone is selling at same rate at local mobile shops, then why advertising best year offer.."
1,I bought this phone only coz it has 50mp camera but it's been a week I have using the phone and it's totally totally worst camera ever.. Any 10year old basic camera phone is better than this.Along time this even the performance is not great or would be usuable for any basic games..Pricing is too highOnly power backup is goodPlease don't buy this phone
5,Nice...thanq
4,"Call recording built-in feature is pathetic as user has to manually click on call record option for each call while the call is going on, then it notifies both caller and receiver saying this call is being recorded which really sounds awkward and the apps available in play store for auto call recording does not work....please don't buy this mobile if you need to auto record calls.Other than this rest of the features are as expected for this price range"
1,Don't wait for updates. Go for other models.Update won't change this product. Build quality not all good.We are fool already purchased. You guys aware of this.Only positive about this phone is battery.
2,All features is so good but camera is very poor
1,Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
4,If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
5,"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
5,"If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 üåü):Processor ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êDisplay ‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êBattery ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in loud ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in 3.5 mm cord ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Selfie ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Back ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êNetworking ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êLack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
1,Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
5,Worst phone.. overall performance is just bakwaz....don't buy...always hangs
4,"I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
3,"Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
1,"Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.

3,"COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"

5,Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
3,"Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones.

5,"Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best.

5,"Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
3,Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
2,Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
5,It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
3,Weary good product  very fast delivery

Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
1,Worst Phone I have seen specs amd buyed it but not satisfied I have samsung m21 mobile which has amoled screen and always on display same they mentioned in this Redmi Note 10s but display clarity is worst than LCD and always on display stays only for 10 sec  .Worst Camera Performnace wise ok Didnt liked this phone and dont trap for technical gimmiks.
3,"All is well but photo quality is very bad. Note 7,9 series is better than note 10s. It's camera need to work on it. It is not capture the details of the photo like previous model of redmi. 48mp camera of Redmi note 9 is very very good than 64mp camera of Redmi note 10s"
4,Good
4,"Phone is tooo good.Battery life is for 15-20 days.Paise toh maine girlfriend se udhar liye hai, wo toh bol rahe hai ki lautane ki jarurat nai hai. Par uss pagli ko ye nai pata ki main sach mein dene wala nai hu.Phone toh mere biwi se bhi halka hai.Baaki camera thoda aur acha hona chaiye tha, wo kya hai na mera ek kaala dost hai uske photo ke liye sarre filter laga ke dekhe, par wo bechara abhi bhi kaala aata hai.Baaki sab mast hai."
1,"I ordered this phone, Redmi note 10s has network signal problem. the voice will break always. I contacted the customer support, i had bought this using 10% off. they are not replacing the phone and asking me to order the phone which is at higher price now. they are saying you can give the review whereever you want. they dont even care about the customer. dont order this product. its waste of money"
1,Don't buy. First ever Redmi product and it's disappointing. Screen doesn't light up when someone calls. (Check attached picture).Fingerprint scanner takes ages and many attempts to respond.Front camera is one of the worst that I have seen in recent times.I don't understand how come such a big company can release a product without proper R&D.
1,Camera quality is very Poor and Display it was saying that Super AMOLED display but it was not worth for it
5,"It's simply superb don't trust any other comments do trust my comment and its genuine comment ,in this price it's best best phone I ever seen"
1,"I purchased this mobile on 24th April with in 2 days i returned this mobile because i had a issue with hearing the opposite person voice. and received a replacement 11th June on that phone i had camera issue.When i open the camera it will automatically get closed and came to back to home screen hence i again returned. Now they said they will refund the amount. This is totally un acceptable.Never expected such a poor service from Amazon and never expected these issues in Redmi mobiles really very much disappointed.Friends, please don't go for this model its my humble request, Thanks"
1,No any front light (indicator) for charging miss call or massage battery life not good medium use one day life back side is  vary slippy display is ok ok
2,This phone doesn't have automatic call Recorder and when I Record call manually its loudly announce  your call has been recording  I tried many applications for recording but I'm unable to record call without announcements  so if anybody want to Record calls  so please don't buy thi mobileAnd also I purchased this mobile with no cost EMI but they are charged me 17%interest  its bad experience with Amazon
3,Google Play store not working. Took one whole day for all the apps and info to be downloaded and finally had to do it through GET APPS option of MI phone. Had to transfer data thru MI MOVER.FABULOUS camera.
1,I bought this phone there is a major problem in network issue I have already returne one phone they give me another one but like same I recommend it to everyone do not buy this  model üëç
1,Having problem with speakers in new redmi 10S phone which I purchased...  basic functionality calls not working properly at all - voice is not at all clear in between cut cut.... infact If we spend 1000 rupees & go for basic mobile  incoming & outgoing calls facility works awesome. But Redmi10S worst. Also the Redmi service center response is pathetic they are not approachable & do not accept the issue what we are facing even if we are coming up with proof. they say we have formatted software & no issue is found also they no replacement  & more over they don't even give any statement in writing verbally say no issue. We do get proof any proof for visiting Redmi service center. worst experience I faced spending 15K & buying Redmi 10S mobile. I suggest not to go for Redmi Mobile as I could see during my visit to service center many people visiting center with newly purchased mobile having one or the other issue... I will never ever suggest anybody to go for Redmi.
1,"Very owful experience first time with Amazon , Bought this for some one's gift but , Camera performance very poor in front camera and rear camera . It's latest vision and quality of Camera very poor don't know it's defective phone received or not !! and replacement is always not available and technician also not available I m very very desapointed with the service and product"
1,"Dear Sir / Madam,I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Mobile Phone and accessoriesThe issue that I have experienced was: I have booked a new mobile ( Redmi Note 10 S ) dated 9th-June-2021 from Amazon and received its delivery on dated 11th-June-2021, When i start using it, I faced a voice disturbance issue initially, I cross-checked my mobile network sim car by placing it in my old phone but there is no connectivity or network issue in my sim cardThen  I tried to reach Xiaomi via their website to customer care & emailed my issue but still, there is no such positive response from their side and still, I am facing such issue"
1,"Please try not to buy this model because I used all the models from Redmi. This is not at all working good.The first mobile after returning(due to Network and High Temperature issue) I got another 10S but this one too is a faulty one. apps hanging, camera not good , battery draining off quickly in stand by mode. I purchased this one by reading positive reviews but u will feel regret after buying this one. don't waste money try different model. always love amazon delivery speed and packing was not good for this product. Seller was also responsive. but fate mobile is a failure model."
5,Experience is going through. Almost good üòä
1,I got the phone delivered from amazon and charged it. Within 15 mins it overheated like an portable iron box. Then I requested for a refund but Amazon scheduled a technician visit then I got a replacement. It had the same issue. Now they issued a refund. The build quality of the phone is bad which is causing battery issues. I won‚Äôt recommend anyone buying this device.
5,"The phone is overall very impressive. After my first few days of basic usage, I can that it is smooth and fast with no lag. The camera is impressive in this price range. The UI is also nice and easy to use. Battery is good but not amazing. The sleek and lightweight build adds on to the value. On the whole I would say Redmi Note 10S is worth the penny.Review is based on first week of usage only."
1,"Very bad camera quality,Front camera-in night front camera is like vga camera,no details in picture.Back camera-in daylight if capture a photo no details is seen,if u zoom the image every part of the pic is blurrVideo camera -my previous realme u1 was far ahed of this that was only 13 mp camera.Front camera-1/5Back camera-1/5Video -1/5Processor is also bad pubg in smooth and ultra settings the phn is heating too tooo tooo much."
1,After 10 days of use i am sharing experience. Incoming Audio is not clearPhotos are not natural at allFinger touch westAutorotate sensor not at allworking. You need to do manually.West product. This should less than 7k
1,"I can't imagine that this is Redmi phone, I am using Redmi brand from last 6 years and this is my third mobile set of Redmi.I am not satisfied and even suggest to others, don't buy any redmi more then 10k and above, its not working well in most of the parameters, so only purchase les. Then 10k price Redmi mobile, don't go much higher.I am totally dissatisfied with my latest Redmi note 10 S, if MI company give me chance I will pay and purchase Redmi 10 pro...I would not prefer 10S.So be care....."
5,"I've been using this phone for a week and I'm quite happy with the product.Battery life - The battery is most capable and can stand for more than a day. It also charges very fast. I'm really satisfied with it. (5/5)Fingerprint sensor -  The sensor is good enough and scans the fingerprint just fine. I personally find the sensor on the power button, a tad bit weird. I'm not used to it, so it's not my favorite thing. I would have liked a facial recognition scanner better. My previous phone had one and I find it a bit lacking now. (4.5/5)Camera - As most reviews have stated, the camera is not the phone's best feature. If you need a high quality camera and that is a deal breaker, then do not go for this phone. The camera is not bad. It's just not the best out there. (The dark mode is quite good though.) (3.75/5)Display - The display is one of my favorite things in this phone. It has an amoled display and it is just great. I love using it to watch YouTube videos and Netflix. (5/5)Speaker - The speaker is just WONDERFUL. I'm very big on music. So the speakers play a huge part for me and I am very satisfied. The phone speakers are loud and clear. I love the clarity it gives on the headphones too. (5/5)The RAM - The phone has a 6GB RAM. I'm not a gamer but I find the phone to function very well. It's fast, it doesn't lag at all. No hanging or freezing. (4.5/5)Weight - Another great feature about this phone is that it is very light. It is easy to hold and doesn't feel heavy while carrying it. (5/5)I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a very high expectation on the camera."
1,"I have compared the phone with a much lesser price Redmi note 10, In almost all factors the RMN10 is better. Am not a gaming person. Even using the camera the phone was heating. Am disappointed in buying this device. One of the worst phones I have bought from Redmi.  I have buying Redmi phones since 2015, till now I have bought 8 Redmi phones. This is the only phone was disappointed.Selfie camera in low light is pathetic.64 MB camera performers are inconsistent. Some pics are good"
4,"Amazon helped to exchange it with my Redmi 1S, which is a great thing. I also got 1000 off instantly from Citibank Credit Card offer.About the phone:1) Battery should be better, 5000 runs out fast due to such a large screen2) The case supplied should also be rugged to protect the phone due to accepted falls3) Charger cable should be a little long4) Assistive touch (from iPhone) kind of features should be given5) No ear phone supplied6) The waterproof rating should be better as in the protection effort should be more"
1,Poor camera quality. Don't buy this product.I have used real me xt before and it's camera quality was awesome. But redmi has a very bad camera quality comparing to real me... Not worth of money.
5,"Ignore all the reviews, trust the Youtubers. Most of the negative reviews are from people who don't even know about tech.This is a worthy Phone even after months of release.Yes, there are better options from Realme but I don't like Realme's build quality and design."
1,"The connectivity technology mentioned in the specification, shows that this phone is compatible for GSM, 3G, 4G, LTE. Bought this phone for 4G sim. After inserting the sim card, the phone did not detect the sim card. Later checked in other websites and found that this phone is not compatible with 3G and 4G. Cannot even return the phone as I have brought this phone abroad. Really disappointed with Amazon."
1,"I ordered this product out of trust. When powering on, I realised display was damaged. If this is how your '100% Made in India' products work, it is a sad state. Since only replacement option was available, I had to wait a week more before delivery. Then the delivery boy says he cant take it back because I hadn't mentioned the reason for replacement (incorrect claim). I have called in for a full refund. Very bad response by seller or the area manager. City Vizag."
5,"I wanted a basic mobile for my children when left alone. Happy with the product at RS 750/- with no camera but with Bluetooth, dual sim and memory card slot."
3,Amazon gives irrelevant information. It doesn't support jio 4G
5,"Two sims and a slot for a memory card. Sound quality and working nicely. Easy to operate and other common things like torch, calculator, FM and unwanted games too. In such a less price you get so many things. Unbelievable. I am happy withLava A1 Josh (Black).If they provided a camera then I can sugar in milk.  People can go for it they will be happy with their decision"
5,"Indian companies, when will you guys improve man.- Difficult to open rear case- Battery once inserted won‚Äôt come out (difficult to remove battery)- keypad pressing gives pain in the arm (softer keypad would‚Äôve been better)Learn to make products user friendly.Working people don‚Äôt have time to use a phone which has a difficult-to-open rear-case and a battery which will never come out once it‚Äôs fixed. Look at foreign companies. They make user friendly and comfortable to use products.Your products must make life easyI bought this phone purely out of Respect for Indian Flag (to encourage Indian make companies). I should have bought a Nokia or a Samsung instead.Please don‚Äôt buy anything because they are Indian made unless you want to suffer. Please go with quality and ease of use."
5,Best phone this price
1,Produces too much heat while charging and operating like a call. Never fully battery charged even 50%. always shows battery low. Totally worst phone. Never buy it.
5,Best product for non camera users.
4,"Very good phone. Value for money you pay for it. Only one drawback is that it doesn't have vibration alerts, due to which you have to always keep it on general Profile. Overall the best phone in this price range."
5,Lava A1 Josh has good supporting features which makes easy to operate the phone at different situations.Text clarity of the display on reading is outstanding.Best performance in sound quality with many options for flexible operation.Phone is handy with optimum size display.Signal pick up for dual sim is good.Voice clarity is good in the good range of signal.FM operation with headset Free is better on good range of signals. Supports too with FM recording.No camera with multimedia options and external memory.Supports 1200 contact phone storage is good and LAVA may see to increase to 1500.Very simple and easy to operate with the support of different regional languages.Battery back up for the full day is OK.Phone back cover found to be slippery may be improved for grip.Good phone with more options in the least price.Proudly Indian.
5,"LAVA A1 Josh...Perfect for secondary device.Got it for 865/-I love it..Compact, basic and value for money with 1yr warranty..After looking at quality of this phone, I can say for sure that it is brother of NOKIA....."
4,"Forget Nokia, Samsung basic phones, this lava a1 Josh is as good as them  with affordable price, looks are attractive, branded like.. you wouldn't feel you helding any cheap price phone in hand.-battery is long lasting..-ring volume is good loud,-Bluetooth is good-mic is good,-auto call record works very fine,-signal reception and call quality is as good as branded phones,.-Torch is good,-In call in ear call voice is super clear, loud, beautiful- Problem is jus screen display clarity is very poor ,- in call loud speaker voice is not clear at allRest all things are very good, those who don't need last 2 things then I will highly recommend this phone over Nokia, Samsung basic phones"
5,"It serves the purpose of a mobile for those who are not very tech savvy but want to keep a mobile for obvious reasons...battery consumption is low. Many year back, when it was launched, I bought it, without knowing much about Lava...but I am very happy owner , it is still working trouble free without battery replacement..."
1,Don't buy this product Handset has network problem between live call it suddenly goes out of coverage area and call disconnected i replace this product one time but second product were also given same problem I think all lot are faulty so don't waste your money
2,"I brought this handset mainly because I used tried other basic handsets and wanted something new.Cons- No separate option to silent message notifications separately, in built ringtone are few, less customisation. Sound is loud, radio is ok.Yes you can use micro SD card but it's all fuzz.Overall not a decent alternative to Samsung, Nokia."
5,It is almost sractch proof. Looks nice in white colour. Build quality is as good as samsung. Battery charge lasts for 4 to 5 days. I recommend this one those looking for basic feature phone.
5,"Audio is good, had all the emergency contacts including covid. Good touch buttons. Has audio speak out for numbers touched for dialing. Very useful for elders and layman basic usage."
1,Amazone Cheated shows 3g but it's not 3g . Don't cheat customers
5,"I bought this mobile for my Mother. Actually, she doesn't understand the smartphone's features that's why I purchased that & She is happy to use this now. It's easy to use, Battery Backup is also good & Sound quality is not bad. At this price, I'm so, happy. Thanks, Amazon to provide such Good Products."
4,"It's made of cheap plastic. Not military grade. But if you're looking for a backup phone, and want to listen to music/radio using your BT earphone this phone is best and cheapest option available."
1,"Wrong decision to go for this cheap product spend 2 to 300 more and go for a Nokia mobile, it it doesn't support the 3.5 5mm Jack and second sim also not working.Disappointed with my decision to go with this product"
3,There is no signal inside the house. Simply waste of money. All my phones got damaged to I purchased it. Wish I could return the item...
3,"Lava A1 Josh Blue Sliver also (white) battery life is so poor quality ,only one day battery life time validity period,also phone support only micro sim card, when you buy a phone see reviews ,it will help you get a good phone.."
5,"I love this phone, It‚Äôs just perfect as simple phone, Battery back up and further features of the phone are good enough for basic phone"
1,The phone was defective. Sim did not gey detected. The return window closed too soon. Amazon pleaae look into it
5,I bought this for my maid and she seems pleased with it.  Easy enough for her to use and loud enough to be heard.  The torch is useful too in power cuts!
5,"value for money.. love the white color, small and light weight , nice design"
4,Better than nokia and Samsung Guru series. Audio quality is fine. Memory card option at 900 rupees. Can basic get any better? Bought twice for those working under me.
1,Total loss of money.  Fully charged battery finished with in hour.. there are no customer support.  Totley waist of money.  Don't buy this lava mobile Poor quality.  There are no battery backup.  Fully charged battery. There are no coustmer support suddenly finish with in 1 hour. Waist of money
5,"If you're looking for a keypad phone this phone is best choice. Network quality,sound quality is at its best and wireless radio works fine. Good effort from an Indian company."
2,Very cheap phone and have great battery life. I don't get lots of calls so my charging lasts for 6 days. Preferred it as it's indian manufacture.But memory card not detected by it
5,I think the best in this price range as compared to other brands phone like Nokia 105Best Sound qualityFMAudio playerVideo playerBluetooth work well
5,"Every feature is so good and value for money really true. Battery life four days... excellent... Bluetooth feature ... Excellent.... Power saver mode... Excellent.... only absence of vibration in call...but except this, all the features so good"
4,bought it for my labour who works daily outdoor. he is absolutely satisfied
1,"as compared with cost it is not user friendly, no ear phones, no options for ringtone"
3,Not any microphone device socket provided by lava....at the time of communication all voice come out from phoe device....same device is not user friendly....and so on.....
5,Dual sim.. not reading memory card.. don't know.. rest all is good and sturdy phone
5,Received fast delivery via Amazon. Good working. üëç less in weight and size. Compacted design. Volume in ring tone alone is too high we need to reduce. Options are not user friendly like nokia.
5,Really light weight mobile great battery life auto call recording available with audio recording as well buy it if you're looking for normal feature phone with great featuresPs I've purchased in 866 if ur getting in lower buy it
4,"good come back motorola keypad phone. but phone is not like before. looks different. have 2 use and test for sometime then only we can say it's performance. overall, good phone for this price."
5,Very nice product üëç thanks Amazon for giving me this product thanksss amazing product thanks again because for this product..
1,Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
3,Camera quality is low
4,"Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying"
1,"1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide."
1,"Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE"
1,I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
1,This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.

1,The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang
1,Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don‚Äôt buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
1,"Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good."
1,"No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy"
1,Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
1,very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
5,Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
1,Hitting issue
1,Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
1,"Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price."
1,"PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK"
5,"This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company."
1,"Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI."
3,Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn‚Äôt give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you‚Äôre choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you‚Äôll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
1,"This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information."
5,"It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it üòå. Once again no complains regarding anything."
1,Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
4,I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
1,Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
1,"Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue."
5,I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it‚Ä¢ Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day‚Ä¢ Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light‚Ä¢ Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings‚Ä¢ 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth‚Ä¢ The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -‚Ä¢ Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics‚Ä¢ The weight of phone is heavy‚Ä¢ The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones‚Ä¢ The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels‚Ä¢ The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range‚Ä¢ It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup ‚àö
2,"The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box"
4,"Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4‚òÜ"
1,Waste phone. don't buy this company phone. already loss my cash....... Waste.W a s t e  c o m p a n y....
5,phone at this economical price is very much attractive and amazing features. Loved this phone. Good to go with this.
1,Purane zamane k phone jaisa hai jisme battery seperate hai or sim card bhi ek nano lgta hai to ek micro. Camera quality bekar hai kyuki photos m to brightness aa jati hai pr video bilkul dark  bnti hai.  Iski flash light se zyada to candle üïØ ki roshni hoti hai. Slow processing hai.  In sb qualities ke saath iska price(4999/-) kuch zyada hi hai.
3,Camera bad
1,Both the slots couldnot detect sim.
5,Nice condition after use 12 months .i recommend this mobile for smartuse.charging capacity also nice . don't waste time to see other mobiles.
5,the phone is quite beautiful. I love this color. Amazing experience and good budget phone. Love to recommend this phone.
1,Received damaged product. really disappointed.
1,Backwash phone no good phone cheap pro. Mediatek 720 screen TFT and battery charger  slow 15 watt only like 10000 phone ..nothing good..samsung very poor phone ..don't buy in 20000 ...TFT like 5000 phone display
5,Good 5G phone
5,"Bought it on the first day of launch. Delivered the next day. Very fast delivery by Amazon. Have been using it for last two days.Pros1. Phone has glass at the back which gives it a premium look. Feels stylish to carry it along.2. As usual, Samsung screen is smooth. Good picture clarity.3. Adaptive brightness 8s one of the best I've come across till date.4. Phone is very light.5. Camera quality is also very good. Front camera is also decent.6. Battery life is more than 24hrs for regular browsing over 24*7 wifi connection.7. Fingerprint sensor on right side is handy.Cons1. Charger is only 15 Watt. 25/30 Watt would have been better.2. Nothing else as of now.I feel good holding and using this Phone. If there is any chance then I'll update the review."
1,"Speakers are very very weak, produce very low sound, you will need headphone or speakers to listen music, I purchased it on first day and now they are just offering replacement which will not solve the purpose as every samsung M32 5G phone has this problem so I would recommend others to not waste their hard earned money in this phone as cost is too high compared to quality"
1,"I sold the phone sameday somehow on olx in 4k loss. Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide return.Phone is a joke.Plain M32 had full hd screen and now with 5G price has gone up by 6k and display is surprisingly half hd(HD+) . This is plain loot.Plastic is cheap.Camera is worst than any 10k phnSlow processorEven screen lags in scrolling, such bad refresh ratePathetic Processor and ramOverall its from 2012 times where HD+ was a thing. This phone is 9 yrs late.Never buy samsung in this segment."
1,"Phone look is nice,Battery drain 65% after normal use 4 hours and 15 min.Camera is not as 48 mp if I compare my vivo phone 13 Mp is better than thisIf I talk about all over performance so phone is only good looking else nothing is in this device is goodPlz don't waste your money"
3,They really need to work like motorola
1,Dislike- camera
1,"After using one month I am writing this review,1. Galaxy M30s is better when compared to M32 5G, M30s has good battery capacity and camera quality,2. The camera quality is poor and the pixels.3. In this phone we can expect only 5G option that too we have to check after upgrading the sim.4. Regarding softwares I will post after updating the new software installation from Samsung,"
4,"Received what I ordered.Received on time which is good, Thanks Amazon Team.Good Quality mobile from Samsung.Cheapest 5g ever with 12 band support.Purchased for my wife she is happy with phone.This worth and value for money üí∞ I would say.Sky Blue üîµ color looks premium!"
2,Over heat is produced while charging and when wattsapp messages receive and downloading. Spoke to customer care executive but they are not ready to take return
5,"Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range."
4,"Cons:1. Charger Adapter is only 15W Fast Charging unit. It takes  nearly 2 hours to get fully charged2. Charger wire length is less than 2 feet (comparatively less to the normal length of Charger wire )3. Fully charged phone will stand only 1 day if we use the phone at full level (use internet + calls ) through out the day.Pros:1. We can use secure folder option for securing confidential info/apps and data when we hand over the phone to some body either using finger print or pin or a pattern which is different from phone pattern.2. I got phone with RAM of 6 GB and installed several apps and used , phone doesn't show any slow down in speed.3. Finger print sensor at side switch on/off button seems to be attractive."
1,"Good phone till now except the finger print button location which accidentally pressed always when we are holding the phoneUpdate: reducing a starFacing glitches, not able to hear when I call to some body at first, if I keep try 2nd or 3rd time, then only I can hear.If it connect first then voice is not clear. Never faced any of these in my earlier realme phCharging time taking hell lot of time.Update: pls don't this phone, it's speaker is not clear, when I call its giving some disturbance not able hear the voice clearly"
1,"It's a worst mobile phone ever, Samsung proof that they are loos their credibility in India. This phone can not be worth more than  8k to 10 k. Camera is very poor, You can only use single Sim if you are using Micro SD card, Display is very poor , plz don't buy this phone. I think Samsung is going footprint of NOKIA ."
1,"The quality of camera, screen and performance or not at all good.camera quality is very very poor not even capturing photo like a phone of cost 3k. And the return policy of amazon was worst. Not a proper response by the executives of amazon. They are not accepting the return of this product, don't know the reason behind this. Dont  Why they are enecouranging sale of this product,  when they are getting similar problem form multiple customers.  Belief on amazon have worsening day by day.. literally disopinted with the amazon."
4,"I have had used many Redmi phones. I am comparing this with my Poco M2 Pro:1. Narzo sure does feel premium compare to Poco. It's OS is clean and blotware free.2. Narzo feels much lighter, but I weigh on scale Poco and Narzo weighs the same. I think Narzo has better weight distribution.3. Camera is good. I feel no difference compare to Poco. Night camera is average, it cannot capture all the details what our eyes can see in low light. Poco too doesn't fair well in low light.4. Calling is okay. Speaker volume is much low: forget using speaker phone. Poco has very loud speaker volume. This is only downside.5. I liked Amazon giving flat exchange for older phones, albeit lower than Flipkart. Flipkart devalued my phone further upon inspection even though phone met all the checks.6. Summary, if you are tired of using Redmi phones, this is better option @ 10K."
5,"Very happy with Realme UI and the phone‚Äôs build quality. I was not happy with Redmi phone OS and wanted Realme phone for my mom around 10K. This one is really good. Pleasantly surprised that the user interface is on par with Google Pixel 4a stock Android. Weight of the phone is evenly distributed, so won‚Äôt feel its heavy. Not very bulky and good battery backup as well. I think Realme should be the brand to go for budget phones. Yes there are so many models, but we have many options to choose."
5,Good

5,Another outstanding phone...Just go for it
4,Display is not perfect but it is good
4,"Best Phone for Long Battery Backup, Gaming, Bright Display & Camera. No hang while using smartphone. smooth experience, best UI.Camera: 4/5Battery: 5/5Display: 4/5Performance: 5/5"
1,Most worst part of it is Amazon is backing it and causing problems to the customer. Please don't buy this product especially from Amazon. In India there is trust issues..
2,"First of all those who wants best performance phones can buy this and don't expect anything other than this.Pros:Super performanceBattery lifeRealme UI 2.0Cons:1. Camera ( Worst even if it 50MP it takes pictures like 5MP. Front camera is too dull.  My old Redmi 4 phone gives good front cam quality than this. Front cam worst.2. Display (It gives 360pixel output when videos Play in 720p. Even 720p wallpaper also displays like 320p)At least they should give FHD display.Even 9K price we get FHD display.3. No case provided, no inbuilt tamper glass( For this price these to be included in the box)4. Last but not the least, Overpriced. These featured phone to be come in 9000/-This is my review frnds, those who needs only performance can buy this. For other features don't buy."
1,battery issue and SIM card slot 2nd not working; Call Amazon Customer support they are not even trying to help me over this issue saying you need to wait for some time instead also checked by their tech support team in all ways by downloading the app and performing the test.So not recommended the Purchase of a Phone over Amazon like a lot of issues and not resolution with Tech-Support.Rather buy from somewhere else.
1,Plz don't buy itWorst camera phone taking selfie like cheap VGA cameraFront and back both camera worst.It's a joke of 50mp actually it's 8 or 5 mp camera.Don't waste ur hard earn money on such a garbage mobile
1,"There is no official Information, If it has gorilla glass.They do not provide back cover only Screen Protect Film is provided."
3,Realme should change the audio jack spot it should be placed in above side it very very wrost and bad because due to this the earphone get out of oder to many times my 2-3 earphone has been get out of oder
4,First impression is amazing in this segment.
5,Nice phone good camera and sound quality fast charing nd many more features at ds price .
5,Realme made a very good product at this price range.I buyed this on Great India sell so i got some discount.Battery life is good.Camera is good but not like 50mpxl.Display quality is also good and there is no issues regarding brightness.Overall good product
5,"Thanks to amazon for this product  & for your best services you always provide.  Fast delivery, nice packing by amazon.This phone looks good. Blue color looks cool. Camera is ok not looks like 50mp but it's ok. Battery back up is also fine. Speaker sound is also fine.I got what I wanted. Face unlock feature, fingerprint sensor, fine camera, fine speaker quality, good battery back up, 128 gb ample storage, 4gb ram. I think these are the features which most of the people want. I don't know whether it has the gorilla glass or not.At Rs 9,999, I bought this phone & I am satisfied. Looks are also good."
3,No screen protector film and case in this box as written in the discription.Thats disappointing.
1,"Sound Is very low , phone touch don't work properly, hangs very slow ,  camera is worst ever came across , don't scan QR code before 5 minutes (for whats app web)Good for calling and receiving calls (basic use) because of battery 6000 mah ..Do not come under honey trap of discount , useless model so heavy discountWasted money , as Amazon return policy is poor ,No support after sale , trust app not the technician who visited to check"
1,No replacement first time in history product defected unavailable to teke photoFlash light intensity very low
3,"Hi, I was quite unhappy with this phone. Video calls and speaker calls sound is very low. Unwanted pre install apps are crowded. Major issue is regarding sound quality. Media sound is low even on full volume. Neede to review after one moth. Will update more."
1,"Camera quality is so poor, is not like 50 mp camera."
3,Issue only Charger box(big Box look like) other all things everything perfect Thank you Real me
5,Good
1,Camera doesn't look proper.  My advice don't purchase this mobile.
3,"Average performance in such price range. More value for money is expected from Realme.1. Average Camera Quality. Definitely not real 50 MP. Not more than 13 MP.2. Below Average Refresh Rate in this price.3. Infinix offers better phones in 30 % lesser cost and better features.4. Getting just 40% exchange value for just a month old device.5. No Back Case and screen protector.6. Looks Good but delivers less.REALME PUT THEIR PRODUCTS IN EOL ""End of Life"" Series right after 12-18 Months.YOU WON'T GET THE CONSUMABLES LIKE BATTERY AND OTHER PARTS EVEN FROM THEIR AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTRES. I EXPERIENCED THE SERVICE RELATED ISSUE WITH MY PREVIOUS PHONE REALME U1. I HAD TO SELL IT FOR PEANUTS.REALME EXPECTS PEOPLE TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY A WHOLE PRODUCT INSTEAD OF ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF PAID SERVICE AND SPARE PARTS FOR ATLEAST 3 YEARS."
1,Accessories missing  *CASE*  not receive in box..same informed to Amazon..Cameras quality not good as aspects..
2,Mobile is ok. But camera clearly is not good in this megapixel.... Isko update kr ke sudhar karna chahiye...
1,"Totally waste of moneyCamera quality very bad 50mp  camera equal to 12mpDisplay only hd+ not FHD+Battery performance not goodCharger support 18w it's very bad for this price rangeProcessor G85 performance not goodPLEASE CHOOSE ANOTHER BRAND ONTHIS PRICE RANGELIKE POCO M3, POCO M2 PRO, REDMI 9 POWER,"
5,"If you are looking for a budget smartphone that has good battery life, then definitely go for this. The charging time is a bit too much but justifies because it has a 6000MaH battery. The overall performance and UI of Color OS are pretty good which was astonishing because I thought it would be like MI phones which turned out to be wrong. Realme is doing a good job by making such budget smartphones. Would love this phone if it has a higher charging speed, an AMOLED screen, a good camera with a wide-angle lens. Apart from that, it is perfect."
1,"Hi All, don't buy a nokia product during launch.I purchased nokia 6.1 plus for ‚Çπ17500, soon after around 6 months the same phone is available for ‚Çπ9000. It is exactly sold lesser than the launch price.Moreover the phone is not upto the mark. I face charging point issue every 4 - 6 months, I am paying 1.5 k every time. No proper response and solution from Nokia. Nokia has lost its quality."
1,Phone does not support 5GHz broadband speed.screen protector (preinstalled) is not tempered glass.Received July update for Android 11.
3,In the era of slik design nokia is producing bulgy phone.it is not having even g80 ..in which gen nokia is in?not even mentioned what type of ram.i don't know who gonna buy it?kindly improve bulid quality and design
5,"I have been using a 32GB Nokia 6.1 for the last 3 years. Nokia 6.1 was an Android One phone which gave me two Annual Android updates (from Android 8 to Android 10) and 3 years of security patches. The security patches stopped with the April Patch. This was the time I decided that I must now look for a new phone to continue to get monthly security patches and Android updates.Nokia G20 is not the ideal phone to replace a still sturdy Nokia 6.1. I did not see any other suitable Android One phone in the market to meet my expectations, so I settled on the Nokia G20 because of its ready availability.My 32 GB Nokia 6.1 was very tight on storage space and I had to regularly delete some files I would have preferred to keep. So I wanted a Nokia phone with 128 GB of storage that started with Android 11. Currently, I did not find any. So I compromised on a 64 GB Nokia G20.Before using the new phone I merged the contents of my and my wife's camera and WhatsApp pictures using a PC.  I did this so that I can continue to maintain them using the Google photos storage captured from two different phones. Now I had all the pictures taken on my wife's phone as well as the pictures she received on her WhatsApp. The merged contents from a 64 GB Nokia 6.1 and a Nokia 32 GB Nokia 6.1 could fit within a 64 GB Nokia G20 after deleting short-term Good Morning type messages.When the Nokia G20 arrived I charged it and copied the contents of my old Nokia 6.1 contents on the Nokia G20 from Google Cloud. This process did not go through as smoothly as my past experiences were. I did a factory reset of the Nokia G20 couple of times and still, it did not help. Things were not smoothly installing from Google Play Store. A few Apps did not get installed because they were very old and Google decided that they will not work in a new environment. Some old Apps, though they were working on my old phone had been removed in the Play Store and could not be found. Because of these anomalies, the automated restore process did not go through smoothly, and the App icons did not get restored on the screen.  So I manually installed all the remaining Apps from the Play Store and copied the App Icons to their familiar place on the screen. After restarting the phone everything seemed fine.Now I started WhatsApp on the new phone and restored the WhatsApp backup and it worked okay. Till now my sims were in the old phone and now I moved the sims to the new phone and everything seemed fine. After taking a WhatsApp backup and Google backup I was now ready to copy merged contents from the PC.The copy process from the PC to the phone took a long time because of the large number of small files. Everything now works fine and I can see the merged photo gallery. I once again backed up WhatsApp and Google photos to the cloud and now everything is fine and I still have 26 GB of storage for future expansion.Some of my observations:Moving from the 1080x1920 Nokia 6.1 to the 720x1600 Nokia G20 is restricting the screen area.  I knew that I will be making this compromise because of my other choices.For many years now I have been used to the fingerprint scanner on the back and it took a little bit of time to get used to the one on the right largely used with the thumb,In my earlier phone, the VI connection was almost always absent while the Airtel connection was active through the WiFi calling option and VoLTE enablement. I was surprised to find that in the new phone both the sims supported WiFi calling and VoLTE. So my VI connection now has better connectivity in the new phone at my location.Earlier when I read about the Mediatek G35 chipset I noticed that the chipset supported only a 13MP +13MP or 25MP camera and I was wondering how could it support a 64MP camera. Taking pictures I have figured out that the phone normally takes 4000*3000 pixels or 12 MP photos with 1.60-micrometer pixel size.  My Nokia 6.1 had Zeiss 16 MP camera with 1.0-micrometer pixel size and this was again a compromise. I will retain my Nokia 6.1 if I really need to take 16 MP pictures. It is possible to take a 48MP pixels picture using 0.8-micrometer pixels. At this low pixel size, image quality is expected to be poor because of the smaller pixel size and the interference between the adjacent pixels. When 12 MP photos are taken four 0.8-micrometer pixels join together through a process known as pixel-binning to function as a single 1.6-micrometer pixel.I have now been having this phone only for the last 3 days and my impression of the phone is based on what I have read and observed. I don't think I will be able to use this phone for full 3 years as I have used my Nokia 6.1. Whenever my service providers start supporting 5G at that time I will have to replace this phone with a 5G phone from Nokia. Till then this is a good cheap phone with some compromises because of my need for monthly security patches on an Android 11.I am satisfied with the new Nokia G20 as it meets my needs. I don't think I will run out of storage very soon as new pictures will only be 12MP and not 48MP about which I was concerned earlier."
5,"I bought this mobile for my parents, and their major use is WhatsApp, some social networks, commuting and banking apps. And they look for a phone which has a good battery backup, large screen and decent performance. G20 is a right fit for them. Build quality is sturdy. Go for it if you are not looking for a phone for gaming etc.,"
5,"For the price it's more than your monies worth, especially if you see the prices of some other brands in the same category. Working well, nicely designed and what else does one want? Go for it."
4,"Writing this rivew after 1 day use. If you're looking for desi mobile like avoid China wala phone then nokia is great option for you. When you start your phone very first time you love the sound of nokia with welcome screen, phone will take an update of 276 MB which will take half hour for setup. Design is good but expecting some basic features like basic headphones in pack, notification light missing, some times proximity sensor not working properly i.e when you talk on your phone and place your phone on ear, screen's light automatically goes off, some time it feels lag while using frequently camera or any application. Battery and camera is good at this price. I think battery will go for 2 days. As I mentioned above little lag issue which I have faced it's not good for gamers. If you are a basic user or wanna gift this stuff to your parents and grandparents go for it, ha Nokia ringtone lagana na bhule you will love that sound."
1,"I am changing this review, because, accidentally, when I tried zooming while capturing a video, I was able to see some of the grains. I have scheduled a technician visit. Will update once the issue is solved. Hopefully, I will be able to return the phone"
3,"Right now I will not recommend to buy this phone because I am seeing Nokia to delay the MONTHLY android security updates.It is a decent android smartphone which is similar to smartphones from other brands but little bit costlier than same specs smartphone from other brands. The extra cost is only justifiable if Nokia can provide regular on time MONTHLY security updates which most of the other brands are not doing.I have recieved the October 2021 security update on 5th November 2021. This is not expected from a Android one phone. October update should be delivered by October only. There are many other phone manufacturers in market who sell phones cheaper than Nokia, only advantage of Nokia is their all andoid phones are part of android one program and someone who wants regular updates would want to buy it. But if Nokia also can't provide security update on time then there is no advantage for Nokia and current Nokia owners will buy some other brand's phone next time. I will sure switch to some other brand's phone if Nokia can't provide security updates on time.Update on December 1, 2021: I have received November 5,2021 security update today ( December 1, 2021 ).Update on January 3, 2022: This phone has not recieved the December,2021 security update yet."
1,"Read carefullyIf you use smartphone 3-4 years then it's same like this..Speed is almost same of 3 years old technology phone.Build quality is ok but processor is almost dead.Think twice if you wanna purchase itHonestly says don't buy this handset.I know that Amazon can't post this review,they want to sell this and make our fool"
4,"I have always used Nokia phones from school days itself.  I still have a Nokia lumina 730 and a Nokia X phone at home both of them still works fine. When I went through the spec sheet of g20 there is nothing much to brag about. But I have been using it for a while now. It works beautifully for sending mails, zoom meetings and occasional social media. The phone has excellent call quality.  Also pure android interface is clutter free. Looks premium and solid to hold. The package was slightly damaged and unlike older Nokia phones there is no tamper proof seal. HMD has to definitely improve on that part. Phone camera has great output in average lighting conditions. I bought it for data security and the bloat ware free OS. EXCELLENT PHONE FOR THE PRICE. Yes you will get Chinese brands with better specs. But this one meets my purpose."
4,"The phone is simple and safe. OS update for two years and safety update for three years are added advantages. No heating problem even after watching movies and web series for hours. No pre-installed un-necessary apps. Good battery life. 1.5 days even after watching web series is not a problem. Compromises are display quality, camera quality and slow processor. However, if you are not high end game player to than the slow speed is not a problem. You can have a high end DSLR for photography. No mobile can compete with a DSLR. But the phone has very typical problems. Taking screen shot is a pain. Going back to the previous web page, especially in Facebook is not possible. These problems are surprisingly there in the phone."
4,Got this phone after my 6.1 and wanted a bargain.Biggest pro is good hardware equal to QC 665 chipset at a low price. Nokia build quality and good cameras and clear loud sound. The main camera has a good night mode which was a surprise. You don't need to charge everyday.Screen guard and good quality silicon cover included.Cons here it is bit heavy. The stock Android 11 is very new and I seen few apps just closing. No back button so need to use gestures. Hopefully the software will improve. The phone takes noticibly longer to start. Frame is ok plastic build.Update after 2 weeks: good performance but noticed the phone did not restart normally onfew occasions. The new Android seems to be very buggy.
5,All time Nokia performance üíØ/üíØ& Nokia G20 Excellent
1,Missing headset
1,Bug with 5ghz wifi
1,"Worst phone I had ever used. Such a poor product from Nokia. Not at all worth buying.Too slow, functions are not proper, you cannot create multiple copies of whatsapp if you are using dual simColor combination is not proper. Other phones in this category are getting are far better.Takes a lot of time to recharge"
2,"UPDATE - Review after using for a month:Pros:Look and design are fantasticStock android gives an ad free experienceComes with pre-installed screen guard along with a transparent protective caseCons:Fingerprint sensor is not consistent. Sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Disappointed with thisTouch response is slowReally tough to switch between apps during callsSlow in response when trying to view media with more than 500 filesSlow in response while unlockingWhen you are in a call and if you need to use any app, it becomes really tough to switch as the phone does not respondTaking lot of time while opening applicationsOverall, performance should have much  better for this price. Would not recommend this to others"
1,"Very poor performance and you can not return it. You have to live what you get. It can only be replaced only if their technician visits you and Mark it as a problem which certainly does not happen. Moreover even if you get a replacement, it will be of not use. The device performance is very poor. Not sure how one can give it a 5 star? Not expected from brand like Nokia and a very poor customer support from Amazon."
2,"Disappointed with nokia. Dont recommend.Sluggish processor performance that is visible in normal usage. I dont think it will support heavy games.Basic shortcuts missing, you have to dig deep to reach them.Fingerprint sensor refuses to respond many times and face lock works according to its wish.Poor camera interms of performance, no image stabilization. Images will be blurry if you dont keep your hand steady.Only satisfactory thing about this phone is battery life. But at this price it is not even close to redmi phones under 8k.Nokia has lost its quality and trust.I regret buying this phone."
5,"I love the Blue colour but Nokia G20 with Dark Blue is awesome and I bet everyone will love this colour. I got this product yesterday, will update about the same after using it for few days."
3,Better go to nokia 5.4 compare to G20.
3,"I always like phones without any adware and bloatware and Nokia phones are perfect for that.Nokia G20 also is good on that front.Battery life is very good.Camera performance is good.I like Fingerprint reader also on the side.Performance could be better as it gets sluggish sometimes, so better optimization is required.So in all its a good phone."
5,"Excellent phone and value for money. In day light ,camera is awesome. Battery life is very good. OS is neat and clean. Better buy in this price range."
5,"48mp camera really good, macro 2mp super, great battery backup, value of money."
4,"NOKIA G20 is a simple smartphone devoid of any sophisticated features ideal for the needs of a normal user. Its  build quality is good, has a decent battery back up, fairly large screen, and decent performance too. Ideal phone for Senior Citizens too who wishes to migrate from a feature phone to smartphone. The disappointing feature is the lack of screen switches to reverse or retract the pages if swiping fails.  The finger print sensor could have been placed at the back rather than at the edge. Design of the SIM tray needs enhancement. I would give it a 3.5 stars rating."
3,"I got this phone, as I did not want to buy a Chinese phone. The only options were Nokia, LG, Samsung.Using this phone for month now, and this is a below average phone.PROS:Camera: The picture quality is good at this price point, it has night mode. Photos are crisp and clear.Battery: It lasts for 1.5 to 2 days. However, I am not a gamer or heavy phone user.Screen: The adaptive brightness is not very responsive, however screen is fine.CONS:Pretty much everything else:Finger print sensor: Its on power button, this takes away the feature where you can scroll down and see notifications tray. Also the sensor keeps on reading the fingerprint when the phone is in pocket. This results in phone getting locked. You will have to enter passcode very frequently.Processor: This is very old and slow, it hangs very frequently. resulting in phone restarts.Responsiveness of phone: This might be related to processor, but the phone gets frozen too many times.Overall a very outdated and below average phone. Nokia need to ramp up a lot to compete with Chinease phones."
5,Nokia as always a steardy body build phone with h good materials.Camera.  Though not great but good for this priceCharging usb good oneDisplay goodProcessing for normal use goodSize found very big to handle.  Can be little less
4,"I'm giving 1 star less for quality control issues on Nokia's part. I received a defective unit at first which had camera issues. The replacement process is a huge headache - Amazon first requests a technician to inspect your device who never turns up and makes excuses when he calls you at the end of the day, then you have to talk to customer care who offers replacement (which could have been done at the first place).Overall it's a decent phone; fairly good camera, battery easily lasts for 1.5 days with normal usage, and stock android which means 0 ads and bloatware. The only thing that needs work is quality check in manufacturing: Nokia shouldn't be letting out defective pieces at the first place, so that customers don't have to deal with the tedious replacement process."
1,Don‚Äôt buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON‚ÄôT buy this mobile
4,"Let‚Äôs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them.

1,"My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone."
4,Good
1,"Redmi9Too many disadvantagesCamera quality is worst:both front and rear.Processor is very slow.Body is plastic and which is uselessDisplay quality is very badMicro usb charger: this wonder, since all model new phones are coming with c-port, but this phone with old model micro usb port.Video calling is issue.Heating issue during charge aswell as during the call,You can't video call and many more issue.And you can't return the phone in Amazon.Totally this phone is gutterchap quality."

3,"Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience."
4,Overall good mobile...But Camera not good as expected.Overall Performance is good .Value For Money
2,I was having Samsung before same 4gb ram and battery back was very good but in redmi with out much of space or app ram speed is very very slow and battery back up draing with a day so not happy with the redmi product .I can return to Amazon with in 7 days but unfortunately our building is effected with covid possiitive so totally issulated no one should have contact with us so can't able to send the return mobile
3,Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good
1,Very very poor camera.its look like jio 1500/- camera and supplier not responded regarding this issue
1,The phone is very hang and some application doesn't work properly....Pls don't buy this ....If you are try to return it will having lots of stages and procedures.The performance of this phone is very bad...Redmi provide 4gb ram but it having Below 2 gb experience...Poor network connectivity and some times it showing blank screen...Very waste products...and big lose of money.........
3,"This is my review after 1 year of purchaseProsDisplay 4/5Speaker 4/5Finger print scanner 5/5Battery backup 5/5Phone is good if you are a beginner to touch phone, the helio g35 processor is good for day to day task but there is some hanging problem but too rare, ram management is not upto mark, some time google browser crashesh, camera is below average you can take photo by managing. There is some bugs in miuiConclusionIf you need a phone for study puposes go for itAnd if you are a casual user then go for itOtherwise don't look into this"
2,"Cons :- Orange Back different from that shown in product pictures. Not attractive.- No battery charging indicator light.Once the mobile goes in sleep mode, you cannot figure if it is charging or not.- Defective Sound System : volume is generally low. No Bass At All. Sound Volume goes up and down on its own while playing songs/video.- Extremely Short (half meter) charging cable- Micro-USB B-type port- Outdated handset. Not worth the money.- No RETURN Option despite receiving defective piece- No Option to schedule technician visit before replacement window closes (all slots permanently full)Stuck with a defective handset.No scope of Return & purchasing another model.This feels like fraud.Disappointed with Amazon for the first time."
2,"Phone is only for Calling, Whats App and Youtube.I gifted this phone to my mother, so as per her usage i felt its okay.Worst part is camera.... I even had Redmi Note 4.... I seriously felt Note 4  camera is much better that redmi 9.I got this phone in 7500/-"
1,"If you ignore this review, you ll end up regretting. Camera quality of this phone is worse than you'd have ever had. If you click a selfie you'll look an old person. No color, no texture. You can say that it's a budget phone and all that. That's true but even a simple one megapixel camera has 100 times better camera. Not exaggerating.Battery also a bit weak. Don't buy"
1,Waste phone. don't buy this company phone. already loss my cash....... Waste.W a s t e  c o m p a n y....
5,phone at this economical price is very much attractive and amazing features. Loved this phone. Good to go with this.

4,"Lava A1 is pretty good for the price. It has all the features you would expect in a basic phone. Personally I use a Redmi K20 Pro smartphone and I needed a break from it sometimes. I bought this phone for that purpose. One good feature is that the radio does not need earphones for reception. I guess it has a built in radio antenna. Satisfied with the product but minor scratches have started to appear in just a few days. Claiming it has military durability is kind of doubtful. But overall satisfied with it. Good sound from music, excellent call quality, satisfied."
5,I ordered 02 handset on 24-Aug-2020 and issues started with the one handset from 5th Oct. 2020. Handset automaticaly switched on and switched off. Voice is not clear and sometimes no sound. I am really getting frusteted with this handset. I really trusted on the Lava brand which is our Indian based company and I am using other handset of Lava as well but with this handset I am really not happy.Kindly return or refund my product asap.
5,"This is a 2G dual SIM mobile having expandable memory capacity of 32gb. Very  loud and clear sound quality. I have used mi basic headfone, It is working smoothly with it.Cons:The battery icon has no battery percentage information.The color of battery during fully charged, during discharge, and during low charged conditions are not fully understandable."
5,Awesome product
5,Nice mobile purely made in India Amazon delevery on time thanks for nice mobile
5,Best Indian made phone in Budget. High quality materials used. Completely made in India
1,Battary Backup is less than 3 hours  even in stand by mode.Mobile Phone is great but battary is so poor.
1,Mic completly stoped working in just 18 days. And amazon return validity also expired.I went to lava service center. He given me choice for phone replacement or change mic  only.He told me that i will get new phone. So... i opted for new phone.After 4 days i went to service center and they provided Refurbished phone with no bill.It was not new.... i came to home and just shaw screen was flickring..... It was a big disappointment. It happens sometime so i did not went to service center again.I went 4 times to service center. Booked bike and total cost exceded around 250. Plus 749 for phone.Please do not buy such cheap quality phone. You will be in trouble.
1,"The call log is not updated as per time stamp.  it has a weird logic in call history.Repeated calls with the same contact will be seen at the timestamp of  first instance , ie not at the recent top.In simple words call log management is a disaster."
5,Great product + on time delivery! Got the very fresh n new item 4m Amazon! Opted for this after trying 2 wice with Flipcart but received used product! The attitude of flipcart customers care forced me to say no to them 4 all future orders!Anyways the product is osam in the said segment with light n outstanding phone with confirmed 6 days battery life!
5,"photo image or caller id image is coming while calling ,mostly senior citizens can use this option  , accessing the phone is smooth no lag at all,mainly voice call speaking clarity is sueprb,lava standards are given perfectly what they have in given their website ,small phone but very handy to place in pockets ,one more the button pressing and unlocking fast is superb.battery backup is good,body part material is given strong material only not like cheap material , we can open battery panel infinity times nothing will happen,that much strong quality material is used.superb"
1,"Buttons are very tiny.Back cover is very tight, one should use tweezers to open it.There are no caller group option , no white list option while other mobile in this range offer these features.In short it's a average basic mobile.*********Update********After using this mobile for few weeks I found that this mobile automatically send sms. I checked the sms counter settings. Moreover sent messages are not found in ""sent items"".I don't know what kind of mobile is this. So think before buy this mobile."
3,"Value for money,  nice good looking phone... But the package not contains headset ( in phone box itz written as contains headset  but no head set present ) no head set whyy...???"
5,I gifted to my mom... She is too happy with this phone.. Good sound quality which notifies you from a quite distance abt phone calls.. Torch is also nice.. Light weight.. Easy to use..long battery backup.. overall a good phone for non 4G users ..üòÖ
2,"I bought this a few weeks agoPros1.good battery life2.20 W speaker sound3.Alarm sound Is good ( it can wake up an entire village with its sound)Cons1.Feels cheaper(it's cheaper, still...)2.not so good build quality"
1,"Very bad product, don't buy this phone.Charger got out of service and phone also not charged with other charger in 4 months only, and Lava care ask repairing is chargeable in warranty period also."
1,"Utterly worst..The outer back  cover is jammed because of this you need implements to open both cover and battery. When I replaced with another , the problems persists which is applicable for phones of this model.Now it's lying in corner..Go for good brands Nokia / Samsung etc..It's my bitter experience . Ultimately choice is yours.."
1,Phone is very slow. Poor quality. I bought two phone Same model. One is not working. End kee is not working. This is saftware problem. When I press end kee it's taking long time to open.
5,"This is very good Basic handset phone to buy under budget price. The Delivery was fast and precise, the Packaging was good.Always charge for 3hrs and then use after opening the pack. The Fit and finish and feel of the phone is good and easy to operate. the sound quality is good enough, the phone is Light weight too. The White Color makes its look more elegant. A very good phone for secondary usage..apart from your primary handset. wish they had provided handsfree also."
1,I do not have an option to rate you less than this. For an emergency bought a cheap basic phone only for calls. Worked fine for about 20 days. All of a sudden speak mic and ring stopped working.For Rs: 800 phone you make your customers spend 1000/- fooling peopleI guess poor people by this kind of phones. Stop cheating poor people by giving fault products. You will never come up in life
3,"pros: dual sim, sd card slots, bluetooth, good battery life, mp3player, video player, camera, good built , loud speaker and earpiececons-  no vibration settings and vibrationsif do not have budgets go for it"
5,"It's a good basic feature mobile phone. You couldn't ask for anything better from brand at this price point. It has a dual sim slot with dedicated sd card slot, vga camera, fm radio(wireless), music and video player, some games and all the basic stuff.The only thing it misses on is the vibration mode. Otherwise it's a really good phone with a good battery life of around 2-3days in moderate to high usage."
4,All-over it's good but I didn't get headset of this phn...üòí
5,Very nice product..iam really hpy to see  this...tanks to Amazon to deliver quickly...
5,"For 749 you are getting an usable music player, wireless fm, bluetooth (but does not connects to wireless speakers).Only con is that it misses one basic feature i.e. vibration. It does not have a vibrator i guess.The phone does not have stopwatch and timer. (Additional info)"
5,"I bought it by seeing positive reviews but yes, this is an amazing device, I think better than Samsung and Nokia according to the features and overall usability it gives.Pros:-1. Amazing battery life ( it is fully charged since 4 days after so much usage and talktime )2. Vibrant great display3. Battery saver feature4. Good camera for ‚Çπ9005. Earpiece sound is amazing, too loud6. Keypad is great7. Software made by Lava is also so smooth and fast working with no lagging.8. Tough and robust body9. Many things I can't recall now, but all are good, You must not think much for buying it... It is a true value for money. Great work Lava, and it is fully MADE IN INDIA!!!!----------------------........-----------------------Cons:-1. Only 1 con I could find that the rear speaker sound is not high while on call, yes it is very low while listening to call on speaker. But other than calls it is very loud. Now I can't understand why this thing occurs,, but anyways I really appreciate the work done by Lava, It's better than Samsung and Nokia and yes other Indian companies like Micromax and Karbonn etc.Thanks"
2,Within one month phone is having hanging problem. Screen blackout. It is forcefully switched to headphone mode permanently.Total waste of money.
5,"Lava A1Got it for 897/-Perfect for secondary device.Good build quality and performance, compact.Signal reception and call quality are perfect.I didn't test camera.Go for it if u need a basic phone as secondary device."
4,The sound is so loud that if the call comes and you're standing in front of a growling dinosaur. The dinosaur will stop growling for a second to check where is the sound coming from.
5,1. The sound quality is good. Better than Nokia2. Buttons tactile feel is good. Lava improve it in low price phones.3. Display quality is better than previous phones and better than nokia ‚Çπ1200phones.4. Wireless FM is a usefull tool for my mother.5. Battery life is average.6. Torch is okayish7. Bluetooth good.8. You can easily move your previous phones contact by backup and restore featureGo for it.

5,"Brilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a shame that this phone's launch was delayed due to lockdown.Highly Recommended phone üòäüòä"
3,"I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range."
5,As a title it is obviously a monsterAnd very very good performance
1,"Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device."
5,"Its a one season wonder. All was good till the one year mark.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great for one year. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I was more than satisfied TILL ONE YEAR.After the one year and two month mark the phone started to automatically restart and freeze every 5 minutes of usage. Went to Samsung care and they said the motherboard has issues and need to be replaced and asked me to pay Rs 8000 since the warranty period was over. To my surprise the issue was not only with my phone. Many M21 buyers had the same issue, although some were lucky enough to have replaced the motherboard in warranty period.So my point is this phone is not a Rs 14499 phone instead it is a Rs 14499 + Rs 8000 phone if you want it to use it more than 1 year. In brief it is a Rs 22499 phone. You can get better phones in this price range.AVOID AT ALL COST"
2,Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were1. When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..
5,Very Nice Mobile good all
1,Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition.
1,"The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement."
1,Now Amazone has REPLACED THE DAMAGED ONE NOW THE PHONE IS GOOD ENOUGH...PREVIOUS ONE WAS Nonsence What A Nonsence Battery It Comes to 90% Charge After a full charge only if u do something in10 minutes.... What nonsence is this. NEED REPLACEMENT. Do you people think customers are Mad.
5,Just one word AMAZING
1,"After 5 hrs continuously  charging level reach 55 %,during call sound quality not clear,a lot of heating problem,camera quality not good,network issue,slow processing..poor performance"
1,Heating problems
1,Otg pendrive not supported
1,"This phone's video,photo quality and audio quality is very poor"
5,"I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.üòÄ"
1,"Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated."
4,"Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21."
1,Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.
4,A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.
1,"Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused."
3,"It charges very slowly, though they claim that it has fast charging?Has anyone else also facing this issue?"
1,Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.
1,1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It‚Äôs better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.
5,Value for money
1,What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money. Before this phone I already have 2 phone of Samsung's working good but this phone made in India is hot like a oven.I can't take it near my ears .I have to use ear phone.I call customer care they give me different different idea but problem remain same.I don't give advice to buy this product to any one be careful.
5,"Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung üëå"
4,"I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours."
1,Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.
1,recently i ordered samsung M21 6GB RAM 128GB Flash.Unboxed and started the phone. it surprised to see so much of heated while booting itself.I tried to inform to Amazon . they tested with some remote diagnostics application surprisingly it showed the temperature is degree.I am using Samsung phones long time. this time my experience with M21 is very very badNew buyers please little careful about heating issue
1,Giving only one star because it compulsory. Sensor not working and heating fast
1,Received Samsung M 21 yesterday..highly disappointed  about slow charging and poor quality of camera..did not expect this from Samsung.I suggest not to buy this mobile.
5,I got this phone 11249. Best Display best Battery Good camera and Samsung BrandingSo people must buy this phone this price.Other phone can't beat
4,"Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget...."
2,"I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc"

1,Purane zamane k phone jaisa hai jisme battery seperate hai or sim card bhi ek nano lgta hai to ek micro. Camera quality bekar hai kyuki photos m to brightness aa jati hai pr video bilkul dark  bnti hai.  Iski flash light se zyada to candle üïØ ki roshni hoti hai. Slow processing hai.  In sb qualities ke saath iska price(4999/-) kuch zyada hi hai.

4,Working as i wished.Easily connected via Bluetooth from multiple devices.Fast print.Nice autocut. Reason for 4 star is printing quality is good not best.Might be paper roll causing the issue. Yet to check.Rest a perfect device for me.
5,"Best option for a Bluetooth thermal printer..Daily is frequent , prints quick and the auto cut feature is really helpful"

1,"Previously I was using HP Deskjet ink Printer 3545e, replacing cartridges costed me around 1500 and then if i don't use it for a while ink was getting dried up fast. So i taught of upgrading to a Ink Tank printer then I decided to purchase HP Smart Tank 530. When my product finally arrived, using it for a while then I realised it was really a bad decision to go for HP Smart Ink Printer. I dint face issues with the print quality, print quality is great but the main two issues i faced with the printer was touchscreen was not so responsive and in between the display freezes. Second issue was with the built quality,HP has used low cost plastic to built this particular model i‚Äôm not sure how long i can use this printer.  My personal suggestion is that please don‚Äôt  buy HP Smart Tank 530 Printer rather consider buying Epson Printers or other good hp printer models which will last for long and wont regret later after the buy."
1,"The printer is easy to install and doing average printing, there is no installation from hp or Amazon provided. And print quality is ok or same like 410 in price of 11000 and I feel I made wrong selection in high cost.Moreover whenever I print on gloss sheets the colors are comes out on my hands.and printout fades.very very bad product in high price.not to recommend anyone"
1,Was delivered a defective product. Moreover while checking online support on HP's website we found out that the warranty period start date was August 27 when we had purchased the product on December 25. I guess the reseller is trying to scam innocent buyers. Be aware.
5,Pros :-*Wifi printing is effective*HP Warranty is covered (provided you have registered the product )*HP installation is applicable*Anywhere printing through HP smart app or email*Printer quality is good*Works with Alexa seamlessly* Touch screen pad is smooth* extended warranty is recommendedCons :-*Automatic duplex printing  is not available this is the biggest drawback with such an expensive printer .*Little Noisy* printing tray doesn‚Äôt hold printouts effectively . Papers fell down after 2 to 3 printouts* printer may have 10 to 15 days old warranty as the product is sold by reseller on amazon . Do check this immediately on HP website before you install
5,"This printer from HP is an awesome one. It has Wireless , Wifi Direct, USB connectivity.A real time Ink Level indicator is what i like. You dont have to either print printer status report or check it using front panel or using printer software.2 Black ink bottles are provided in the box.Setup was smooth. HP Smart App supported.Overall a good product from HP."
5,"I received brand new seal packed product. Initially while setup, I added ink and then when I have to install cartridges and print the alignment page,  then i saw the holder where we have to fit the cartridges it was hitting the printer left and right very hard and not stopping in the middle. I called HP support and they tried to solve the issue over phone with sew trouble shooting steps. However result was same. HP arranged the service call for me and I also talked to amazon support for the issue. I explained them that I got faulty product which I can to know after inserted the ink so  I was hesitated to return the product as this might be given to someone else. But Amazon says, this is not my (ME) issue and will be taken care by Amazon even product is opened and they arranged the return and refund as same product was not available anymore with them.5 star for AMAZON.Both HP and Amazon was scheduled for next day. Luckily HP guy came firs and fixed the issue in 2 minute by unscrewing 4 screw and placed the transparent encoded strip in position (sensor behind cartage holder). He said this might happened in transport. Once it worked, i canceled the return request.5 star for HP support.Printer:Black ink is pigment and hence once printed on paper it is waterproof even if you put the printed paper in the bucket full of water.Color is not waterproof, however they don't fade easily.ADF: This is the plus advantage in this printer over HP 515. Just keep the bundle of paper in ADF and get the scanned or copy without any mess.INK: I got 3 color (GT 52 70 ml), Magenta, Cyan, Yellow each and 3 black (GT 52 XL 135 ml) you will get only 1 black in HP 515 which is 2000 cheaperOverall printer is good.5 star for Printer."
3,"Print quality is excellent but when you print via Wifi, printing speed is slow (can be ignored).It has been just a week now, very often noticing cartridge issue. After couple of prints have to open the door and set the cartridge.Other than this haven't noticed any issue."
1,1 page printing it's take 1 min (60 sec. )Very slow printing.High quality printing.After 2 .months ink pipes is blocked automatically. . RS 17000 loss
1,I BROUGHT HP 530 INKTANK PRINTER ON AMAZON SITE. THE PRINTER PROBLEM HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE BEGNING. SO MANY TIMES COMPALINT RAISE. NO USE. ONE OR TWO TIMES SERVE TECNICIAN CAME AND CHANGE CARTIDGES BUT NO USE . AGAIN AND AGAIN COMPLAINT. NEXT THE TECHNICAIN CAME AND REPLACE PRINTER. BUT FEW DAYS OK AFTER THAT PRINTER PAPER JAM AND PAPER TORN. AND NOW THE PRINTE TOTAL DEAD POWER NOT ON. AGAIN COPMPALINT RAISE. BUT TECNICIAN NOT COME.SO HP SEVERVICES IS SO BAD.It's their job to buy HP products by mistake
1,"Ordered this product on October 30th 2021, received the delivery on November 03rd 2011.Box was not sealed!Promptly ran a lookup with the Serial Number (bar-code printed on the side of the box carton) at HP website, shocked and dismayed that warranty was already activated five days ago --- Monday October 25th 2021.Immediately contacted Amazon CS, and replacement was arranged.Received the delivery yesterday, Friday, November 05th 2021, this time box was sealed however, sorely disappointed that AGAIN the warranty had already been activated same date --- Monday October 25th 2021.Gave up because my ""need"" was more than ""want"" hence... completed the setup of the printer but, not happy with the overall experience hence the rating.."
5,"I am using EPSON ink tank L455 since 3 years. I bought HP Smart Tank as additional requirement.I took some photo print on normal A4 size and outcome was outstanding, no ink smudging and spreading noticed.Printer design is very nice, its looking beautiful."
4,"Pros := Compact- Easy to install- Ink filling is pretty easy as well- Has good advanced features (Wifi direct printing, Airprint, Print anywhere..)Cons :- Is a bit expensive for the features provided- No auto duplex..pretty strange. This feature is found on Inkjet printers which cost 7k"
4,"I have upgraded from a Canon printer and I feel it is worth the money spent.Overall:-  Print quality is very good for normal printing. Documents color and b/w are extremely good on normal quality mode.- Photo print quality is good for personal use. It is comparable to some of the prints I have received from photo-studio. However if you are looking for high quality professional photos, this may not meet your expectation and those printers are quite expensive.- There are review comments about ink not drying on photo paper: To avoid this, you have to set the paper type as ""HP Photo Paper"" or ""Other injet Photo Paper""  depending on you paper while printing. Also ensure to use good quality phot paper.- There are few review comments about paper falling off after printing: Again I have found that the out paper tray has two stop options, if you pull it max, then paper does not fall-off.- 2 sided printing and 2 sided scanning is available, but the paper has to be loaded manually after onside is completed. This option works only from desktop, HP smart app on mobile does not provide this feature.- Online HP support is quite useful. The executive tries to help you over phone and if required can take remote access of your system to provide support.- Noise is not too much. If you still want a silent printer, there is quite mode, but the printing speed will be very slow.Printing Speed: Not as advertised but should be quite okay for personal use.Fist attempt - A4 color copy in normal quality took 1min 10 second. and Normal quality color print on photo paper took 4 minutes.Second attempt after cleaning head and alignment: 30 seconds for A4 size photo print in best quality (photo paper)Wifi connectivity: It is quite easy to setup wifi, however I had some initial glitches where the printer was connecting only to 5Gz and not on 2.4GHz. Connected with HP support, but they could not solve the issue. I reset the printer to factory defaults and after that the problem got sorted out.HP Smart App has good option on desktop, but on mobile it has very limited option for settings. This could have been improved.What I liked most:1. ADF allow me to scan/copy bunch of papers together.2. Printer can connect to both 2.4 & 5Hz network simultaneously3. Wifi-Direct option allows to print direct without connecting to network4. HPePrint option is useful if you want to print document from a remote location."
5,"When I say smart, it not only connects with a smart app, it also has a smart display that can not only guide you with the initial installation process, it has a functional aspect to it that allows user to control scan, print and settings functions through the menu available in the screen. Installation was fairly easy. Took me maximum 15 minutes including test print and scan. You can easily connect to your WiFi using the menu on the touch screen and input your password. You can also connect to the printer via Bluetooth using mobile app on phone or on laptop. Printing speed is decent, pretty average for inkjet printers. Nothing too fast."
4,"The printer is very good, well built and look wise awesome.Pros:1. The print quality is very well and as well as scan too.2. Printer looks very professional.3. Ink management is awesone.4. This can be installed as a wireless printer with PC/Mobile anything. I have installed as wireless only, hence less wire configuration and can be kept anywhewre within the same WIFI network.5. Supporting both 2.4 and 5 GHz network.7. Color and Black & white print is flawless in terms of quality.Cons:1. Printer time is little high, probably for the configuration. [One less star for this point]2. Printer set up not so easy, had to take help from Youtube Video.That's it. If anything further experinces will share accordingly."
5,"There are many videos showing how to install and commission the machine. Those indtructions can be followed to prepare the machine for use. However, certain apps/software are needed to be downloaded from HP website/Google store to activate the machine which I struggled a bit. Care should be taken while removing the orange plastic fitting that is to be replaced with the cartridges as it is factory filled with ink and may spill over. After installation however, the machine works fine. The MFD was delivered the next day on placing order. Now, it is too early to comment on the performance."
5,"Good Printer which is very easy to install and given by many videos  online. The process is very simple to install and completes in 15 mins. Its perfect for the home printings with kids online classes and work from home prints.Pros :- Excellent print quality - awesome color prints and black and white.- Excellent Wifi connectivity- Awesome ADF - can scan the 40+ pages in one go- super easy ink refill, and no spilling of ink- HP Smart app was easy to set-up and use"
5,"Excellent printer. Easy to install. The automatic document feeder works like a charm and saved time. The quality of scanning and printing are superb. I always preferred inkjets over laser printers for quality of printing, and the large ink tanks have taken away the pain of frequent (and expensive) cartridge changes. The printer is a little delicate though. Meant for personal use."
3,"Overall speed of Printer with prints and scan is slow. Also, for both side printing feature, you need to feed the paper manually. Where my other 4 year old cheap HP printer can feed paper automatically for both side printing."
5,"Awesome Printer from HP. Thank you Amazon for delivering this. Wifi setup is so easy and Bluetooth connection is an added feature. Touch screen works flawlessly. No extended inktank, ita a compact printer. I like it."
5,"HP Smart Tank 530 is overall a good value for money with following Pros and Cons,Pros :-1. In built Ink tanks, easy to refill and cheaper cost of printing,2. Auto feed scan / copy is a most useful feature for copying / scanning multiple pages,Cons :-1. Bulky in size and does not fit in normal spaces made in most of the computer tables,2. Dual side auto scanning is missing,3. Scanning speed is slow,4. Printing speed is slow and suitable for domestic usage but not for commercial purpose,5. Colour prints on normal A4 papers are not very crispy and sharp"
1,"I bought this printer last month. I relied on HP brand name. Set up and install was easy. But the problem is that it just does not print. HP SMART app is installed and it says printer is online and all is good. But just that when I give a print command, it does not print. I am frustrated with the unreliability of this printer. Don't buy this ever."
5,I bought this printer for 16200rs at sale with card discount. Printing speed is good.First day I had to print around 250 pages (2 sides).It costed me around 200rs approx If I had got it printed at shop It would have costed me atleast 500rs.Two issues I had noticed so far.1. For 2 side prints we have to print one side for all pages and put it back into feed. During this process I once got mismatch front back print because 1 of the first side print had 2 pages stuck together because of which mismatch happened while printing the second side.2. I have two laptop both running windows 10 out of which one laptop was able to install hp printer drivers easily but the second was not able to download the drivers. Not sure what the issue is.If you are looking for printing duplex(2 side print) in large quantity then I would suggest you to go for printer with proper duplex print where you dont have to manually print the second side.I haven't tried printing from mobile but will update once I do.Hope you find this review helpful.
5,"Value Product. Don't think more, just go for it. Printing is awesome and very easy to install, but you also contact hp care for installation i.e. free.Most important Amazon (Appario Retail Private Ltd) have done a wonderful job in delivering the product."
4,"Installing : Little tricky.Print quality : Good in BWColour match : Not perfect match, poor Color Rendering.Scanner : GoodDirect printing : Not easy as HP claimsSpeed : Tad slow, takes time to wake up after a print command.Over all : Good printer with above few drawbacks."
1,Almost using the printer for 6 months and the problems are1.always showing paper size mismatch2.every time it has communication error ...al the print command stored in que and suddenly it prints all of them at once3.Takes lot of time to boot up4.Worst service of HP .....At least booked call for 5 times no body reaches and the complains automatically closed.
3,"I have been using a few printers in my office as well as in my home. I have been suing HP products as well as Samsung and Canon too. I was quite satisfied with HP products, hence when I needed to buy an Ink Tank printer, i went for HP Smart 530 but after installation and Use , I am a bit disappointed as the products isnt upto the expectation.  The efficacy and economy of Ink Tank will , of course be tested over a period of time so I am not commenting on it now. What bothers me is the fact that the settings get modified creating a lot of trouble during printing. Most importantly I need speed but this product is most sluggish. It takes minutes to print a few pages , and the scanning takes ages which is really disappointing as I had bought it for scanning. When compared to speed of  Canon  MF 240, HP 530 is just poor. I admit though that its Ink Tank tech whereas MFP is Laser yet the sluggish pace of HP 530 is something to crib about. More importantly, the after sales is absolutely non existent. Nobody came for installation , my son did it by himself, nobody has ever called to know how is the product or is there any help required."
1,Prints very slow.Print quality is very bad in both color and b&w.Doesn't maintain proper margins on A4 paper. You have to select Letter for proper prints.Body paint peels off. Brand new printer looks like a three year old badly used printer in a week.
2,"Not sure if this is a buy since I‚Äôm already facing minor issues where I end up doing basic troubleshooting.Doesn‚Äôt have duplex scan or print unlike the queries section suggests.And yet, I‚Äôm not sure if there is any other better printer than this with ADF!!"
1,"Pathetic support system.... Don't go by the name HP.They will keep you on whatsapp for more than 2 hours and still won't be able to fix the issue.Wireless connectivity is the worst part.Don't don't go for this overly-priced, dumb (not smart) printer"
1,Colour spilled inside the box. I did not even open it fully.
5,"Printing is of good quality and fast it has 2 scanners glass scanner and documents feeder scanner you can scan ,print and copy from your phone with hp smart app installation was provided free within 24 hours after raising service request on hp website"
1,BAD PRODUCTTIME WASTECUSTOMER CARE IS BAD
4,Printing quality is amazing.Connecting to mobile is simple..The worst thing i noticed is print speed is slow.Remaining all features are worth for money.
1,The official website clearly says the print speed of this printer is 11 ppm (Black) & 5 ppm (Color).We went by Amazon listing which says 22 ppm for Black (twice the actual) and 16 ppm for color (over three times the actual) and bought the printer. Trying to get this returned as my only reason to buy this printer was to get a higher speed printer.The actual speed is very slow. Do not buy it for speed.
5,performance is outstanding. Easy to operate. Inks bundled with the package are not going to empty soon. Document feeder scanning is very fast and clear as normal scan. Printing speed is good.
2,At this price segment this printer is waste of money I am totally unsatisfied with its printing and scanning quality. After 3 to 5 pages print I mark that little much ink is flow around the text and also during the scan it's pixel density is very low
5,Excellent printer by HP.  Quality of print is good and cost effective.  Better than laser printer. This is very useful particularly in lockdown period.  This is very helpful for educational method.
5,Its fast and easy to setup and not too much mess less space is occupied and good for label printing.
5,Have been using this 7 days ! Easy to Install and Easy to Operate !Till now Happy and Satisfied with the Experince !
5,"Printer is good for printing shipping labels for eCommerce and other needs. This is Direct thermal printer, so no ink or ink related thing is needed to run this printer.Print Quality is Good.Print speed is also fast.Printer size is compact. It fits even in small place/table.Feedback to seller/Manufacturer - Drivers & Software are sent via CD which is of no use in today's world as CD driver are hard to find in laptops. They need to change it to pen drive or keep everything available online."
5,I can easily create barcode label directly without any issue. Now a days this device is going to very important. I am very impressed with using this product
5,"Very useful for copying and taking question papers from notes and books.very useful for schools .I am using this for 3 yrs.So far it is good.Very useful for coping , scanning books"
4,Needs manual intervention on book curvature...else functions well
5,Good item. Really helpful.
5,Very good and easy to use
2,very bad scan quality...and for the price.....not at all worth it
3,good
5,"SV600 is the best option if someone is looking to scan books.It can scan into different formats such as JPEG, PDF, searchable PDF, Word, Excel, and Power Point.The operating time can be shortened by turning on the ‚ÄúAutomatic Page Turn Detection‚Äù or setting a time interval after which SV600 will automatically continue to scan.It scans anything from Business cards to A3 size document.If there are multiple documents placed simultaneously, it automatically crops and saves each of the documents separately."
1,"Don't  buy this printer, you can only print 20 to 30 A4 with a cartridge!"
1,"please do not purchase this printer, initially it works smoothly. I purchased it in 2016, in a year i printed only around 50-60 print. in 2017 i also printout only 10-15 copies. Now its not working  as shows continuously light blink and did not take print from computer. I have checked it various OS, other laptops,desktop also. But it wont print, only continuously blinking light. I asked to my friend who purchase same printer before 1 year. He is also facing the same problem. Even he exchanged new printer from thana office becaz his printer is in warranty. The new printer also shows same problem after 3-4 months. And this problem is not repaired, we also given for repaired but it doesnt solve."
4,"Price is so attractive, but consumes lots of ink. And picture quality is okay for this price. And best for office uses.Hp says ink cartridges need to be replaced but it could be refilled easily with the help of YouTube videos.I am satisfied with this product.But now a days better printers with ability to print from mobile devices are available in market with attractive prices.I just wanted a printer for emergency printing needs only so I bought it and I am happy with it."
1,making very ugly sound..and after print 20 pages shows low ink..worst printer ever
1,"‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§°‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ñ‡§∞‡§æ‡§¨ ‡§π‡•à , ‡§ö‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ç ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ã ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§"
5,Bought it for 1.7k worth for the money. I'm using HP laptop so no need of installation anything. Color and black cartridges available in the box. Checked both color and black and white print out. No issues at all.
1,I brought it for home use but product is not working... I try to call Amazon but there is no contact details. Try to refund/exchange it but i was told I can't exchange. How come company like HP and Amazon not responding for default product?? Very very dissatisfied.
5,"Call me old fashioned but i prefer paper over digital, so when it comes to read notes i want them in my hand , or when i want facts over a topic i want all the material in printed form, This printer helped me a lot in that , i got it for 1800 rs from Amazon, and it's worth so much than that , first of all its size is so compact and its built is very sturdy ,and i have a epson ink tank filter at office but this prints faster than that , speed is really impressive! Just go for it , pfa images depicting size of the printer"
5,"Good quality of printing,easy to install, getting colord  prinout eazliy at home use"
5,"Despite of all the negative reviews posted about of this product, I would say that this is a very good printer with competitive price. It always not true that cheap products perform bad. Yes, this one is a bit dedicated and you need to handle it very carefully.So far I have printed more than 100 pages black and white and more than 25 color pages including 6 full page images.You need to refill the cartridges at home, which as easy as to use the printer itself. After refilling black cartridge it is still working well.The only thing that you need to keep in mind that print at least one page daily, otherwise the cartridge will dry and that will create difficulties.Thank You..."
3,"Only buy if you know well about refilling cartridge and troubleshooting problems afterwards. Otherwise it will cost you a lot money. It only prints 100- 120 pages per cartridge. Replacing both cartridge may cost up 1500. So it costs 6-7 rupees per page. If you can refill the cartridge, then it's an value for money printer( then it will cost you time, lol)"
5,"If you are looking for a budget single use printer. This is best in the available products.My previous printer was also hp, but was very old, but there was no problem with it. Just Its cartridge cost was more than the price of this product, so bought this. Size is very small and it easily fits inside my almirah."
5,"working fine from last 15 days. took 10-15 colour prints and its doing good. not sure how long cartage will last but its good for now. Also, i noticed genuine cartage is as expensive as printer :)"
1,"It uses up a lot of ink while printing! And with pictures and double-sided printing, the paper (normal printing paper-A4, 70-75 GSM) takes a long time to even dry! Would not recommend it at all. Do not get lured by the cheap price of the printer. It ultimately is not at all an economical printer."
4,"First it is value of money 100 percentage,and thank u Amazon  delivered the item in 24hrs I unexpected, this printer advantage is print good quality, I print continually 20 pages the print is little bit slow and it's support android phone connect with otg cable working properly, I study many commands in this printer but 50percentage are fake comments iam thinking, we insert a4 size paper means it did not stuck so use a4 sheet paper for good use, and I print 20 pages in 1 day,  so it is good to use and we can refill the cartage easily it available in you tube you can see and fill the ink Easily, The we get 100 ml ink bottle in Amazon or flipksart at the prize just 250 rupees, and I use and command later‚úå"
5,NICE PRODUCT BUY EVERYONE ITS SMALL AND LOW WEIGHT OF PRINTER IT IS BUY THIS
5,"It does exactly what it says. I don't print often so I didn't want to invest in a costlier printer. This worked like a charm,  the colors are vivid, the B&W print is sharp. It's not too slow but it is a bit noisy which is ok. It was easy to set up. Happy with it so far."
5,"We print about 10 pages a month, so this printer is perfect. Yes, it's a bit slow (10 sec/ paper) and a little noisy, but honestly that's nitpicking. The speed or noise are not disturbing in any way. I also read a lot of reviews about cartridges not being available - not true. It was probably an issue in August alone from when the reviews are. Only problem with this printer - double sided printing is not fun. I'm still trying to figure out how it works when there are more than 2 pages."
4,"For very occasional home use, this is a very good printer - I previously had a MFP Inkjet that stopped working after a very long gap of not using it, For those who have very infrequent use, I think this small form factor is better. It is so light weight and fits just above my CPU - see pic! (so I can remember to take occasional prints to keep the printer live). Bigger printers (like Ink tank) definitely turn out cheaper per page in long run provided you have that much use/ year. But in a scenario of WFH in the corona lock down needing to take occasional prints for office and kids school use - this one is the best!"
5,The Printer is good for self home use . But the New Cartridge cost is more or less equal to Printer cost . HP should look in to Cartridges of Economical Printers should be cheap also
1,I am giving 1 star because its sucks inks like anything. Ink cartridge is too much costly and hence makes printer un usable and waste of monty
3,"I have been using this printer since 2019 and I just took prints and thought why not write the truth about it.I have printed over 2000 pages till now and I have been using the same Cartridge that came with the printer when I bought it.I just refill the Cartridge instead buying a new one. The New Cartridge by hp can only print 50-60 pages. You can refill and prints as many pages you want.Buy this printer and buy the ink bottles you get. 2ml of the refilled ink gives me at least 60-70 prints.The ink bottle will cost you around Rs. 150-200  and it will have 100ml. That's roughly 5000+ prints give and take.So total investment = 1500(Printer) + Ink(200) = 1700/-That's roughly 2 rupees per print! By the time you get around 2000 prints, your printer cost is covered and the next prints will be free of cost."
5,"Guyz. Dont go for any kind of cartage printer.. if you really need a printer, go for ink tank printers. I know its costlier, but almost 30 time (calculated) more efficient.. believe me of repent like me.. ,,ü§£"
2,"This prints 20 to 30 pages only (incl.black and color print outs).The main drawback is once the original ink is over that's it..its a waste..either.You have to buy Hp black and hp color inks(price is higher than the printers price) or buy local brand inks and get an average colored print outs.My opinion is to better buy good printers which is more than rs.10,000/- so that the cartridges refilling costs you less and also you can take good qty and qlty color prints."
5,"Its good in this price range,  if you want to printer only 10-30 print in a month then buy otherwise go for laser printer if you need more printing as for more print , cost will be higher.Its for home usage"
5,Good for home use.its speed of printing is so best than other colour printer.its print quality is also best. but only one thing which is not good that it's cartridge cost is high.
4,Nice product
1,"11-Dec-2021 - Writing review after 1 year of use. It is worst printer. paper jams frequently. Faced nightmware with this printer. five attempts to get 1 print. Not good at all. Never buy this product. Please ignore my positive review below which i gave 1 year before.It does the job alright. Easy to install on my dell laptop. As i use this to print confidential document occasionally( 3 to 4 per month) , it serves the purpose. Prints fast. Quality is also acceptable on Draft mode and Ink Saver mode. But the only downside is that although i used the black and white for printing 25 pages so far, the ink level on color catridge reduced to 50 %.  Not sure how this is possible. But black ink came down to only 75%."
1,Aftervtee prints only black cartridge stopped working properly. Printing half text. Did all trouble shoot n cleaning but it gives hard time
3,"Warning! It does not work with Mac. The printer was detected and job queued but nothing prints. I had to use a windows computer to print. In terms of quality, it is average. Cheap printer can't expect much. Black print few letters are smudged or unclear but acceptable. I'll probably throw it away once ink is over."
5,Awesome printer... Bought for only ‚Çπ1900 during the early benefits for prime members of Great Indian Sale Prime Benefits.. Must buy this printer for home use... Happy to use..
2,Read carefully before you buy. This seems to be an old model.
2,Software CD is damaged and I am unable to install the software. After printing 20 document pages the cartridge shown less than 50%. I wants to return the same but option is available in my order but it do not proceed after second step.
1,"Don't ever buy this printer, the catriges  will be empty just after 10 prints and no matter how many original Hp catriges you buy from Hp the printer never works. This printer is just a disposable printer. It never works after printing 10 pages. The seller didn't even gave me any invoice with the printer I am cheated by both Amazon and Hp."
1,"Never buy HP printers. I did this mistake 3 times. Wasted a tonne money on cartridges and repair. The actual problem is ""HP DISABLES YOUR PRINTER remotely"" if you ever use a cartridge more than once. Especially if you refill it. They want us to buy their ridiculously expensive tiny cartridges every month! If we don't use different ones, they disable your printer. It happened to me twice while using hp inkjet printer and DeskJet printer.I bought this printer in August 2020 and it's disabled in September 2020! Due to lockdown I used a refil ink and bam!The printer was printing with the refill ink offline.As soon as I went online with printer connected to my laptop, it won't print again!!I haven't registered with HP. I thought if I don't register this won't happen. But still happened. Now I have a light blinking printer with me, which won't print.Hp is the worst."
1,"HP is selling absolute trash in the form of this printer.I have been hardly able to print a few pages and the printer is now not taking paper correctly.I tried all options but it always takes one end of the paper faster than the other and so the paper gets stranded in a slanted manner right at the tray, wont go in.Very disappointed customer, have been cheated before on HP laptops and now add a HP printer to the list. Never going to buy anything HP from now on, much better options out there.Stay away from this cheap excuse for a printer."
5,"I am writring this almost after 2.5 months of usage. The printer printed almont 100-120 black and white pages and only 10-15 colour pages. Those of you who are using windows10 on old laptop and PCs, installation can be a bit of a challenge. But the printer works fine even with old laptop models. Follow the following steps to installing printer drivers correctly:Go to : https://www8.hp.com1.Go to support option2.Click on Softwares & drivers3.Click on printer image4. Type ""HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1200 series"" full name (no initials) in the textbox5.Click Submit6.Download all the softwares, drivers and software utilities under drivers tab before installing for smooth installation.Note: Please check printer compatibility with your system before buying."
2,"Its cheaper to buy this entire printer again rather than buying it ink cartridges,One cartridge prints about 30  A4 pages at best quality, its a good emergency-use printer, but seriously dont waste your money, save up a little and go for an Ink-Tank printerThis has way too many problems for its costBut, the print quality is surprisingly amazing, the printer has that plug and play usability and its a one click print kind of a printer.Still the concept of ink cartridges has scared me enough after buying this printer.....would never recommend anyone else to buy this"
2,Product are good but not CD drive and missing 1212 drive in online
3,"Printer is good for home usage where u don't need to print daily or in bulk..its not for students wanting to printing study material, bcz it only prints 120 pages after that u need to refill cartridge..also since it's a basic printer, it's kinda slow.Otherwise print quality is good and colours are great and vibrant"
5,Very good product and fast scanning. Great thing is that you can connect directly to LAN and use it from any computer on the LAN. No need to connect the scanner directly via USB.Technical support from Kairee is very good
5,"Speed, Accuracy, Clarity, Classification, Requirements and üíØ% satisfaction!"
4,Charging higher for the cover.

2,it was working all fine and smoothly before i update my os to the latest version. it stopped working after updating to the latest mac ossierra version.  apple is doing everything to stop support accessories if it is not from the apple accessories.  isn't this illegal or someone should really sue apple to the court. its a first trillion dollar company in history of the world and such unethical business practice. i hope some powerful lawyers r reading this comment.
5,"I bought this cable to use between my new LG monitor and MacBook. It was working really good, trouble free while it lasted. The cable shield is of good quality and strength. Absolutely worth the money however the cable I received lasted for about 6 months before it developed a small quirk and used to disconnect randomly. I instantly claimed the warranty and it was hassle free service, big thanks to Cloudtail."
5,"After using mutiple connectors available in the market and being disappointed by their quality, I decided to buy this cable, and I am happy with the product, I use this to connect my Macbook Air to Optoma GT1080 and it provides a stable connection and fast data stream, virtually there is no lag that human eye can register on normal usage. Build quality is good, length of the cable is apt and the delivery and packaging by Amazon was good. Highly recommended!"
4,"That cable has a mini display port not to be confused with thunderbolt so , yea I was mistaken and got to know that the hard way and realised that my Mac has a thunderbolt not a mdp,so I didn‚Äôt get to use it .I requested amazon to return the product as it  useless  to me ,but they wouldn‚Äôt and so here I‚Äôm stuck with this cable."
1,"Pro's:Cable sleeve quality is decent.Con's:- Not HDCP Compliant- Picture is grainy and has plenty of forced refresh errors on most MAC's- Works only one way - MIniDP to HDMI and not the other way around- Very Expensive for the cable length (629 for 3 Ft? are you kidding me?)- Cheap gold plating on the leads, will wear out easily over time.- Depending on the MAC you are using, this may or may not support 1440p at 60hzWhat was truly disappointing was the AMAZON POLICY around the return of this product. Hear me out amazon, dont sell cheap products like this and then not accept a return. For the premium you are charging, atlease have the decency to refund the amount and not just replace it with an equally disappointing cable. I dont need a replacement, I need to return this.Amazon customer service rep refused to fix the issue even when i offered to purchase something else in return for my money. I am now stuck with this ridiculous cable and I have no use for it.Be very careful before you pick up this product or until amazon decided to fix its return policy and push better products into the market."
5,Really its work great .. it support macbook air 2018 model even thunderbolt also... watch movie and play games through a big screen üëçüèª
5,"It‚Äôs very difficult to find apple compatible value for money products. Since it was tagged as Amazon's choice, thought will give it a try. Works really well on my MacBook Air 11‚Äù. Connected it to my ‚Äònot Smart‚Äô Samsung TV and the screen replication is seamless and there is no loss in pic quality. The material used to make it looks sturdy. The markings in the connector are clear."
3,"The 6 ft cable worked fine for me connecting Mac to Sony TV,  and also Windows to TV. But the 10 ft cable works only with Windows. Mac does not detect it. i get ""No Signal"". I tried with two sets of 10 ft ones by using amazon exchange with the same result.  Also i tried holding down the ""Alt"" button on the Display settings page which brought out the button to force-detect display. Even that button does not help detecting the 10 ft cable connection. HTH."
3,"The cable seems durable and good quality , however it is not HDCP complaint . In case you are trying to stream Netflix /Amazon Prime you will be stuck at 540p and won't get HD. A real bummer if you planned to use it for video streaming , works ok if you play local HD files though ( e.g shot on your phone etc). Also this does not support more than  1920x1200 or 1080p . They have mentioned in the specifications so take note if you want to use with 2K/4K displays otherwise you will be stuck with 1080p on a 2K/4K display which is essentially useless."
4,"Amid the Covid 19 pandemic, doing work from home using 14' laptop display was a task. Was badly missing the 24' external displays in office. So I was left with 2 options : Buy a external display or Connect laptop with 43' TV which i am having. I decided to save some cash and went for the latter. Here is my mini review:+ Connected seamlessly with my Lenovo L470 & Acer Helios 300 (2019) laptop with MiTV Pro+ Its a passive cable and not a active one. It worked well while connected with Intel HD 520 of Lenovo and GTX 1660Ti of Acer+ Both audio & video gets streamed on target device which is TV in this case.+ Build quality & finishing is very nice.- I wish the price of the product was a bit lower. I didn't feel good spending 850rs for a cable.- Although 15ft may be enough for most people, i needed a bigger cable to connect my personal rig setup with TV. However cable more than this length probably lose its full throughput.Will surely recommend this product for anyone needing mdp to hdmi passive cable"
5,"Go for 6ft cable instead of 3ft.This Displayport to HDMI cable works as advertised and flawlessly. I use it to connect my macbook air (2015) with an external samsung monitor and it works very well. Cable quality, data transmission, and pins - all work well.3ft cable can be bit small for most use cases - my suggestion would be to spend some more money and go for 6ft cable instead. My macbook air's display port is on right and external monitor is kept on the left - side by side. The cable is still bit tight."
1,"This cable does not work for pc to display port (Monitor), it works from Monitor to PC which is not required, So What I mean to say is PC should have a mini display port, and when you convert from Mini display port to HDMI there is a loss of signal, so the combination from Mini display port to HDMI is of no use, and production of this cable should be stopped if you want no signal loss,So if you want to return the product on its deadline say 14th August, you will have only the option of replacement till 14th August and you wont be able to return this item, so order carefully, this is the trick being played"
4,"The product quality is good.Audio and video quality is also good.I have noticed an issue when using it with my mac. Sometimes my mac doesn't recognises the cable, and I have to restart it few times to detect it."
3,"Resolution support is only till 1920x1080. HDCP also supported.But higher resolution will not be supported. I bought an LG ultra wide monitor with max resolution 2560x1080. I wanted to connect the monitor to the mini DP port of my laptop. When connecting with this wire - that resolution was not available.Build quality is good though. But when HDMI to HDMI supports greater resolution, I don't understand what is the use of this wire?"
3,"Good product to own if u have an old MacBook Pro or any mini display equipped devices. Connects perfectly to the Mac and the monitor and picture quality is as advertised. This is an HD cable so it won‚Äôt support higher resolutions, so keep that in mind if you have a 4K monitor or a device that can project in 4K.One small downside is the cable is a bit hard i.e. not very flexible. That‚Äôs not a problem for my desk setup but can be if you are trying to fit it into tight corners."
5,"I bought a 15 feet long cable to connect my Macbook Air to the TV. I am writing this review on the first day of using it so I really can‚Äôt comment on the durability. However, it appears that it will last. It is working and the colours are good. I can watch lectures on the TV screen now and saves me back and neck trouble. There were some reviews which said it doesn‚Äôt work for Apple. Well, in my case, it is working like a charm. So far so good."
5,"Excellent cable from AmazonBasics for my laptop. I tested it with FHD TV and my laptop. Screen quality signal is very good. My laptop screen resolution is 1440pixel and tv is 1080p, so image is stretched. Audio quality is good too. I planned to use it with my projector, for gaming and movies. Overall satisfied with quality and flexibility. Connectors are gold plated. Cable is long enough (15 feet) to connected with ceiling mounted projectors. A affordable and must buy cable if you own a device with mDP."
3,Am having Lenovo Thinkpad T450. This is not working with it. I saw some comments that this will work with T450 model in the Q&A section. But it is not working. Just sharing this for the sake of other customers. Do not buy for this range of Thinkpad.
1,The cord couldn't connect my macbook to Samsung TV. Only screen saver could be seen over the screen. Replacement was received but again the same problem was faced. Amazon is not providing the option of refund.
5,The cable works perfectly with the MacBook. The picture quality also is top notch. But do remember that the cable can transmit a resolution of 1080p at the most and not 4K.I own a MacBook Pro (Late 2012) and a Mi TV 4. And the cable connects both the devices without any trouble and seamlessly. The picture quality is to the highest and the audio clarity is amazing too!Absolute value for money. And seems quite durable too!
1,"Totally disappoint with delivery system third party delivery by ""Delivery courier""  after waiting of 7 days they refuse to deliver on door step and kept 2day in courier fesility hence  I have gone to Delivery and received it they even don't care of you canceling the order. so I canceled my other two orders, so please check and make sure is this product is fulfilled or delivered by Amazon if you do that,  you may not face same issue. The Product is 10/10, Its durable, great product quality, and working perfectly with my thunderbolt display port."
1,Working perfectly in MacBook air 13.3Quick access quality is awesome..After 6 month start rusting on thunderbolt point.Giving 1 star because there isn‚Äôt option of giving zero
1,"I purchased this product to connect my Inspiron 13 Laptop to TV but actually, it is different and allows I believe Mac connectivity only. Bad is you can return this item since it's configured in such a way that they are offering to replace only. So before you decide to buy please ensure read product details properly otherwise you will lose your money."
5,Using this cable with Macbook Air and my LG (22MP68VQ) Monitor1. You might find the cable length short but its exactly 3 feet.2. Easy to connect3. Picture quality is good4. Cable is thick but i hope thats for durabilityIts been just 3 (9 hours daily) days since i am using it so I'll update after 1 or 2 months.Edit : After a year it still works like a charm.
1,"You cannot watch movies on Prime in HD. The cable stopped working after a year. If you're a mac user, I'd suggest buying the original products. It may burn a hole in your pocket, but they will not be troublesome."
1,"First of all there is no option to return this product. Only replacement will be possible. Though in the product description, it is mentioned that this cable can play upto 1080p, it won't be able to play even 720p content. I can only watch SD i.e 480p content in prime video with this cable. Absolute waste of money. Wrong marketing of item by AmazonBasics. Btw, I bought from Appario Retails if it matters.Also the wire quality is just basic, it is not of good standard like the usual HDMI cables."
4,Decent product. It connects to both mac (older) thunderbolt ports and microsoft surface pro mini display port. It does fit better on macs. On the Surface it protrudes a bit creating some doubt whether it has actually connected. But it does the job of projecting to tv
3,"I ordered this cable thinking I can connect  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) Mac books. It supports the Thunderbolt port for the older version of the mac book but the early 2015 version. I have to get another HDMI cable to connect the Early 2015 version mac book to connect to the Dell monitor.I googled a lot thinking it's the device driver problem. But the same mac book connects through dell monitor via another thunderbolt to HDMI cable."
5,"Good quality product, was able to even connect ultra wide screen monitors with this.Though I don‚Äôt think this is capable of 4K output.I bought it to use with my MacBook Pro which has HDMI and Thunderbolt 2 / Mini DP port"
1,"Bought the cable in advance and monitor arrived after the the return period was over.The cable is not detected by the monitor.However, other HDMI cables in the same port work fine."
2,This is a nice product and can be used on mini dv port for video out only. product description on product listing says that it carries audio also is not true.
3,"The cable displays only when I am logged in to my windows boot camp on my macbook air. Doesn't display screen when logged in to Apple mac. I have tried connecting to both monitor as well as my smart tv and the result was the same.So, if you are looking to connect and project your windows screen then it works like a charm but if you are one who is specifically looking to connect and display your apple mac screen then you will be disappointed."
5,Excellent in all respects. Had purchased cheaper cables earlier which stopped working very soon. This connects seamlessly to all Mac machines as well as Windows machines having a mini-display port. Will definitely recommend this.
5,i m using it for my macbook Air to connect with my lg monitor. it works wellquality of wire and plugs are very good
5,Please read before buy and match type of cable you are looking for.Quality is by default great for Amazon basics so no questions there.It would have icing on cake if length of cord would be little extra by few cms !
1,"Build quality and sturdiness is good but please stop answering questions in the section above to which you don't know the answer to. This cable does not give an 75hz output it is limited to 60hz, literal waste of money who needs higher refresh rates."
1,"This product does not comply with stipulated HDCP standards for such products. When I used it to connect my Mac with my TV, the picture did not show up on the TV screen and an error message was shown on my laptop that the product did not meet HDCP standards.This is a sign of a failed and defective product and a waste of money!"
5,"I wish i ordered a longer  Minidisplay to Hdmi cable.As it is its serving my purpose ,i still can return and order a longer cable as i am within  allowed return time.Previously i mistakenly ordered Mini display to Display port cable as the picture was not clear and i had to return it."
1,"Very bad experience. It came in a damaged box. But I thought it's a wire what could be wrong with a wire. Turns out, it was twisted badly from DisplayPort connector end and worked for like 5 minutes. It's getting dicey with Basics products now."
1,"I brought this cable on Amazon for office setup at home, suddenly it starts to flicker and  it's not stable. I tried with the original cable given with the monitor it worked. Please don't buy this"
1,"Ridiculous, We received a broken red brick in the box. I heard such stories from friends and others on social media but today I've experienced it."

1,"This is  is not a user friendly product, trust me.I had an epson L150 -the ink tank non wifi one.The build quality of that product and print was excellent .This on the other hand was rubbish,If I print over wifi direct even if quality is set in high ,It still is a 5/10 print.The ink tank seems to finish ink fast.The epson app is the worst,so undeveloped and troublesome to use.I can't find a way to connect the printer to the  wifi ,I can't  find a way to use remote printing  or to even register my product on the epson site as INDIA is not listed in the countries allowed to register.It's low quality printer.And who uses a wps router? I don't see why I can't directly connect my printer to the wifi without that.The bottom line is ,unless you want to break your head using this product.Dont buy it,my cousins got an hp wifi printer and I used theirs ,setup was easy and overall side by side.I really realised how bad epson is at their tech.The last printer I had was good but this one is disgusting and low quality build.I REALLY REGRET BUYING THIS PRINTER AND I DON'T LIKE ITS BUILD QUALITY OR PRINT QUALITY."
1,"The printer is best for first 14 days (its my personal experience) afterwards its start showing problem of ‚Äòboth light blink‚Äô i.e. paper jam, no printing no copy. After searching the solution in YouTube (due to pandemic situation onsite visit are hold by company) it came to know that, this is a universal problem in ‚ÄòEPSON‚Äô printer and surprise that still the company not able to solve this.Once log the call, the call center revert quickly while discussion with the technician he confirm that it‚Äôs a hardware issue need to solve in service center only. My frank opinion before anyone wants to purchase this please visit YouTube and search ‚ÄòProblem in EPSON‚Äô."
4,"Using this printer from last almost one year . I received it on time and nicely packed.  To connect, it is not very easy because there is no digital display.,But managed. Print quality is good but speed is slow, but for average home use it is good. To refill ink it is very easy. Although I haven't refill it since purchase as I print 20-25 pages average in a week.Right after one month of purchase it had some technical problem and it stopped working.  The scanner cum xerox part of machine was faulty which need to replaced.  But I must say epson customer service was  good . Within 24 hrs technician came to my home . Although to get the faulty part it took some time , but  Epson took care of it. Technician was good and he explained me everything . Since then no other problem till date . Its works perfectly well with phone or laptop,  android or apple."
1,"I have been using this printer for couple of months now. I have another brand single function printer too, the quality of documents printer from this is not at par with other brands. The printer stops prints abruptly inbetween a print operation and WiFi direct is not reliable. I contacted technical support who inturn assigned me a service engineer who was of no help to me. Printing B&W photos gives a blue tint or greenish tint and I have retorted to online printing for the same. Some of the photographs come out with poor dynamic range whereas my old printer could handle anything thrown at it. The software is sub par and looks like some cheapish Chinese alternative softwares and not one supplied by a professional printer manufacturer. If you just want to do casual printing with a mix of photographs it's fine, if you are looking to print on a day to day basis then look elsewhere!"
1,1st : printing quality is not good as u think2nd : not easy to use3rd : head damage very early4th : you have to call a technician every month5th: ink tank Air bubling prolem6th: paper jam problem7th: Wifi connection problemI buy 2 printers but the same problem with both
4,"I was looking for printer for printers 10 prints a day ...so i discussed with friends. All my friends said buy anyone Epson or HP all good but buy INTANK. Hence i read everything. For my case EPSON, BROTHER were coming to best. Hence my friend was using EPSON from 4 years ..so i blindly bought it.1. Printer speed is good2. Resolution for print is good3. Cost effective4. Works wireless via phone, win, mac laptops.5. Easy to use & installI think you can blindly buy it. Warranty is 30K pages or 1 year whatever comes first.Any queries let me know.All intank printers are good but depends on use case.If you use case is Printing pics etc more ..go for Canon or HP. ElseIf color printing is not only thing ...rest all parameters EPSON/ brother are good.Go through youtube video people explains is it well"
4,"Best all in one printer, however the printing of photoes does appear to be a little bit of low in their quality comparitively to canon and the Gsm support could be higher,Scanning part could be made a little bit fast, even for lowest quality scanning, it's takes around 1 minOtherwise for Xerox, and printing B/w this is THE best in the competitionThe print speed is takes around 25 second for one sheet on highest quality for B/WThus a good alrounder for home use, while i would not recommend for colour printing and mainly on higher gsm"
5,"I got this to print few pages since we are all working from home now. Set up was super easy, just download the software from Epson website (they give a CD but who has a CD drive anymore?). Really have nothing to complain about.Pros -1. Connecting to WIFI was easy and the printer has stayed connected for over a week. No drop in signal.2. Wake up from sleep mode and to print was really quick, was able to print the first page in less than 5 sec from the time it woke up and started printing.3. Scanner is working good, no issue there.4. Refil was easy, the ink comes in a no-spill type bottle and there is no way you can mess the refill.5. Unlike HP and other printers which use a cartridge, this one uses ink tank. Hence you dont have to fill it up fully if you print very little and not worry about ink drying up.6. App is good. You can basically do anything from the app that you can do via computer.Cons -These are not really issue as they are what defines a low end ink tank printer, but something that can be a deal breaker for few.1. No ADF, it can hold some 10 paper at a time. We need to keep adding paper2. Scans via the glass, so cant scan many pages at one go.3. Original Epson inks are not always available on Amazon. HP seems to have their products much more often and always in qtd."
2,"I don‚Äôt recommend buying this printer... u will not unit‚Äôs not as fast as advertised.. printer stops printing in between if you switch the application and there is no print queue. Print Quality is not that great... but the interface with MacBook and iPhone is seamless with this 3152 printer... HP ink tank 419 is way way better printer than this at same price though the printing is little slow, it is better in all other aspects. u can just give parallel prints and forget, it will print and keep ready but with Epson u can‚Äôt give prints parallel it says printer is busy no option of print queue !!!!"
5,Bought printer during lockdown to print school related things. Did a lot of research to decide between ink tank and ink jet. That plus advise and feedback culminated in the purchase of the 3152. And it‚Äôs awesome!The set up was very easy. Of course I didn‚Äôt read the instructions carefully so it took me a bit more time but that‚Äôs my fault. Set up was fast otherwise. I have set up the WiFi printing - in fact we only use that. Everyone in the house including the  wife and kids have learnt how to print without an issue. Initially it looked like the blank ink was finishing really fast but doesn‚Äôt look like it.Keep in mind initial head allignment will use up ink bit thereafter it‚Äôs great.Not as great as a laser obviously. And I think ink jet quality is better. But for school etc this works very well. Ink jet would not last these many prints for sure.Have been using for around 40 odd days.  The usage has been heavy due to school so not sure how it survives low usage. Did have a minor challenge in registering warranty but a quick email to Epson sorted it in no time.
5,"I have no idea what these low rating reviews are talking about, may be they got some defective product which certainly was replacable..apart from that, the product is great..working perfectly fine..had hundreds of prints in first month and it has no issues regarding prints and scanning..Photo printing quality is also great..I mean I have used L805 model as well which has 6 ink colour tanks and this one with 4 colour tanks is no lesser than that in print quality, just the thing is, you got to know which paper to use..Yeah the build quality looks little loose or lighter, but hey, you don't have to carry it in your bag, it just restes on your table and keeps printing.."
1,"I payed extra to select the L3252 as I wanted AirPrint (Mac and iOS support). The packaging and product label all screams L3252. but when I started setup, the printer was detected as L3250. I immediately called Espon support and they were extremely prompt in responding. But I‚Äôm still waiting for a resolution. The SNo is correctly identified as L3252 while registering and Customer care also confirmed the same. This seem to be a genuine mess-up from manufacturing lane. Very likely just for us Indian customers as many will not be using or aware of AirPrint and hence less likely to voice their concerns. So buy L3250 - Don‚Äôt pay extra for L3252 as you will be getting the same internals with white labelled exterior and packaging"
4,"Value for money for an ink tank printer and can used for home and small office needs.The print quality is good and yield is decent too.However I found the print speed below my expectations. Of course I didn't expect it to give the print per minute speeds as claimed by the manufacturer, but printing large number of pages over wifi is a pain as it takes a lot of time.One needs patience for printing high number of pages over wifi or wifi-direct.Installation is neither difficult nor easy but one can do it by himself/herself too after following the directions provided.But the installation process can be made slightly more user-friendly."
5,"Initial Comments - Needed a printer that could support both windows and Mac. This one fits the bill.Pretty smooth installation for Windows - picked up my home wifi router without any issue, and the printer's own wi fi works fine as wellInstallation on mac was a bit longer - for both Mac OS 10 and Mac OS 11 - the drivers are not pre installed. You need to go to the L3150 series page on epson website and download the driver. Once installed - it picks up the printer smoothly. In less than 30 minutes - i was able to print from 2 windows laptops, 2 Macs and 3 Android mobile phones.Epson iPrint app is fairly smooth on the mobile phone. You could choose the page layouts, number of pages, etc with simple swipes.Filling in the ink is easy enough, the ink bottles are spillproof.All in all - fairly utility printer, smooth installation, and importantly worked smooth across devices.Would get to know the longevity of ink and per page cost over the usage, and would update the review later."
4,"Connectivity is good. I could print from my mobile, Ipad and also from Laptop. Best part is even when you are not using that regularly, Printer performed well. After staying idle for 20 days, I directly printed some photos on Gloss paper. They looked fine. You just need to adjust some sharpness in the Printer App before taking photo print.Back and forth printing is manual here but it is ok. For a home printer, it has reached my expectations."
3,"The installation process is not at all simple. Me being the technical guy had so much difficulty setup this printer. I then had to connect this printer with USB cable to my PC. Unable to setup the wifi part of this printer. Cant setup in the mobile with wifi direct. Scanned one image and then printed it, the print out came very faded. I m still not sure what went wrong in the installation due to which the color print out came so pathetic."
5,"I bought this printer during the Republic Day Sale. I needed one for home printing which was cheap to operate and use. It was received in very good packing. After seeing a couple of YouTube videos and the attached instructions I was able to install it myself. It was a breeze doing it. Using the CD was able to install and configure the printer over the WiFi connection. I also installed the Epson imprint app on my Samsung M31 and it detected the printer immediately. Now, I am able to print from both devices easily. I took a photocopy first which came out fine. I then printed some photographs (attached) which are pretty decent (though not as bright as originals but not totally unexpected). I didn't try the scan but should work fine seeing the way photocopy worked.Looking forward to using it."
3,"Print quality good most of the times but sometimes pathetic with horizontal lines....Very difficult to set up Wireless connections both connecting it to wifi and using it through wifi direct.Epson being such a big brand has bugs in its software... Anyone installing the software can know the wifi password of the laptop as it is very visible right in front after the driver is installing....Also it was an uphill task to connect it on the wifi network...Epson needs to step up their game and make installation user friendly...Furthermore, android app lacks option to print desired particular pages.... In order to print 10 different pages we need to give 10 different commands... Or else we have to use the laptop to print 10 pages in one command...."
1,"Rating 1 start because of their unprofessional customer support and low-quality product which didn't work for 10-12 months.I would say you can buy EPSON, only if you know how to repair printers. Else the EPSON customer support will give you hard time and also ask for advance payment into some unknown individual account to get it fixed. BETTER NOT TO BUY EPSON Printers."
5,"I was looking for a reasonably priced printer for home use (kids projects, occasional letters, photocopies, scanning documents) and zeroed on this model after recommendation from some of my colleagues. After using this printer for more than a month I should say I am pretty satisfied with the printer's performance.Positives - seamless wireless printing, easy set-up/ installation, convenient options for printing (low/ high/ average quality prints)Cons- none as of now, except the absence of a sorter makes things bit cumbersome (single page scan/ photocopy at a time)"
5,"Great printer, was very easy to setup earlier it takes some time around 10min but then works smoothly and also the WiFi is very easy to set up,you will get a print out of your password and you need to connect your phone with your printer using that password once its done your good to go ( sorry forgot to mention please install EPSON IPRINT in your phone then you can be able to print using the WiFi from your phone)"
5,"Let's point out some pros and cons...Pros:1. Prints quite fast, at about 10-15 ipm (b&w), depending upon the contents of the pages.2. Scan quality is excellent, almost like a photocopy.3. Ink consumption is very low, printed over 3k pages so far in b&w, still 1/4th of the black ink is left.4. Prints sharp and vivid images, excellent for photo printing.5. Easy to refill ink tanks with spill-proof ink bottles.6. Mobile printing (wireless) is easy to connect and use, contains most of the features of desktop printing.Cons:1. Unlike laser printers, print quality for small fonts is not very good, pixels are observed on the edges of the latters if looked closely.2. After switched on takes some time to initialize, sometimes it's annoying when you are in a hurry.3. Not a very compact design, outer parts are not so tightly attached to the body.Final conclusion: In spite of a few drawbacks it's a very efficient and smart printer for home and commercial purposes. Suitable for heavy usage (over 1000 pages per month)."
4,"Giving it a 4 star because it has driver issues while connected via USB in windows 10, sometimes device is not recognised ( Don't Know if its  windows problem or printer problem).1. You can see the printing quality from the above pictures (Printed on normal A4 paper, quality may improve on Glossy paper).2. Free installation done within 2 days.3. Scanner quality is awesome.4. Ink cost is low compared to other printers.Note :- I will update the review after 90 day use,about customer support and any other technical issues."
5,"Even though I'm a technology literate, I chose to call the official Epson engineer to install the printer and they visited within 24 hours.Installation process was very smooth and print quality is good enough for a regular home user who needs a print here and there.Printer is easy to install, ink is enough for filling up the tanks well. WiFi is easy to connect and it a smooth ride to print from laptop or phones.I recommend using Epson I Print app for ease."
5,"When self installing the printer - You have to Charge the Ink after filling. Step 11 of Section 2 "" Charging Ink"". To do this after powering on the printer for the first time (and the power button LED has stopped blinking -  you have to Press the Triangle button for 5 Sec - The Power LED will start blinking again - This blinking will continue for 10Min - You have to wait. At end of 10 Min the Power button will stop blinking.Do not  try test print option - i.e. Press Button 1, keeping it pressed Press Button 2. -  It does not work. & in the process of trying for Test Print, it will exhaust your ink w/o printing.The Installation guide states the self filling will stop when the ink level reaches the top bar in the tank.It does not stop, instead  it fills beyond the top bar beyond the transparent window of the tank.One gets anxious if the tank will overflow. That did not happen."
1,"Even after 2 hours of installation, doesn't print a single page.There is no such thing as customer satisfaction once you buy it, they will run with your money like thieves.Just dont buy, it doesnt print anything and Amazon or Epson won't take it back even if you call them within 3 hours of delivery."
2,"Writing this after almost 10 months of usage.The printer has frequent connectivity issues - it gives a communication error and becomes offline. Logged a complaint a few months back and the service engineer fixed the problem with some firmware updates.Started facing the same issue again for the last few days. It does print after a few tries but the scan option is just not working.Tried logging a complaint with Epson today, but to my surprise, they don't have any details of my printer [purchase date, serial number etc] and informed me that its out of warranty [It has almost 2 more months of warranty as per the invoice date].I was asked to send a mail with invoice copy and other details for warranty updation, and now have to wait for them to update in their systems; with no commit on how long it will take.Really clumsy and unprofessional on their part.Would recommend to go for alternate options if you can. I personally have had very good experience with my HP desk jet before.On the plus side, the print quality is good in B/W and acceptable in colour. The one big advantage is the lower cost of printing which comes with the ink Tank option."
3,"This is a decent printer that with a poor interface and buggy software especially for Mac users. The app is also not very good and in fact I regretted changing to this printer.The primary reason for changing was to have cheaper printing due to ink tank technology and that part works well.Here are some issues1. No duplex printing for Mac and manual for Windows2. Poor software that‚Äôs not intuitive3. If pages get over in between a print, the command has to be given again as it forgets the remaining pages.4. No screen in the printer so connecting to WiFi etc take some efforts.Not recommendedPM"
5,"From my two months usage experience,Pros: Easy to install and setup. WiFi direct and thru existing WiFi network options are available. Also you can print on the go from your mobile(ios&android). Easy to fill ink tank. Fast printing and decent quality output.Con: Build quality, paper feeder and output trays are very flimsy though solves the purpose without any issues."
3,"Delivery from Amazon was prompt.Installing the printer is breeze. The information pamphlet provides the steps to be followed and it took around 15-20 minutes to complete it. Configured WIFI-Direct option and have been using it with the Epson iPrint app. The quality of printout looks decent. Tried both colour and monochrome. Copy function is working well too. Have not tried the scan option and printing photos.To the not so good part, the build quality is simply plastic nothing much to mention here.And, they have mentioned that any non-genuine or non-epson ink may cause damages which is not covered by Epson warranties."
2,"Unable to get a print out copy. Unable to get the test page print. Thin plastic sheets compartments, afraid they will easily break  Old hp printer designed much betterbut 802print cartridges too expensive And hp personnel interfering with hp printer over internet."
5,"Fantastic printer for home use with online classes going on.A few features that I find mentionable:1. Super compact, fits even into a small area easily2. Print quality for regular prints is great3. Cost wise very reasonable to buy and also print on ongoing basis4. Wifi and WiFi direct makes it very easy to print from any device from anywhere in the house5. Yet to print photos on photo paper so don't know how that would come out. But printing photos on regular paper came out okayish"
4,"The product was delivered fastly. But the print quality is not good. Getting vertical lines while taking print. So i called for a return. Seller accepted and gave me another new product. Now it is working very well. Initial set up is very hard for beginners, no proper instructions given how to connect it wirelessly and wifi direct. Over all i am satisfied with the experience."
4,Bought this printer after a lot of research...Pro:1. Wireless2. Good Print Quality3. Economical on Ink (Ink tank)Con:1. The WIFI configuration is time-consuming2. Some ink spill from the bottle (not the Printer)3. Scanner scans only A4 ...size upto legal would have been better.
1,"Hi All,This printer needs very frequent printer head cleaning. Without performing the printer head cleaning activity, you will not receive a proper printout. The cleaning job is time taking activity. Not preferable for home use."
5,I received my parcel with intact packaging.Printer is working in good condition. print quaily and speed is very good.Installation process is very easy.Built quality needs to be improved by company. Epson provides the lowest printing cost per page in the market.My overall experience regarding the product is Nice.Just go for it without getting confused with other products available in the market.
4,Product received was nicely packed and received on time. I couldn't install or operate the system because delivered product was not working and required to call technical support team. Thank God they attended my phone call and solved the major problem by replacing its motherboard.I highly suggest that please never try to purchase this item through online. Please always purchase after proper checking from authorized dealers onlySamrom Lugun
2,"My name is SudhakarEpson 3152 printer is very good but very poor quality. Most of the ink is wasted after the printer is initially turned on. Also many times it takes more time to print. The printer I bought recently has a lot of errors. The first of which. Printhead Problem All the lines in the print are coming out. That does not mean that all printers are laid out. Sometimes it can even happen by transport. In any case, I think it's much better to buy on Amazon. The problem can be solved very easily in a very short time."
1,I would like to point out following major issues experienced by me.1.0 I received the invoice without GST number being business invoice. Could not get any help through customer care as there was no direct number to reach the executive. It was all through auto voice and helpless. Please send an invoice to my email ID with the GST number given2.0 The printing quality is very pathetic. Kindly provide the direct customer care help line to redress the technical issue.
5,"First thing I checked is where is it manufactured, glad to find it is made in Phillipines. Setup was simple, some YouTube videos helped. Print quality is good and printer is simple to use. The application downloaded on mobile works like a charm via Wi-Fi. It is very light weight, and build quality could had been better. Found plastic flaps delicate and need to be handled carefully."
4,Good camera. Not wide angle which I prefer for zoom etc. Ring light is useful but you will still need proper lighting in room for good video. There is a control to dim or increase ring light.Picture is clear but colors are washed. (whitish). Plug and play. Auto focus works reasonably well - sometimes takes time to auto focus.The camera orientation is adjustable.
5,The product is awesome. I like the quality and clarity of the camera and have been using it. It is serving my buying purpose 100%.
5,Magnificent product at this price range. Ring light really makes a difference while you are on video calls.
1,"Pros:1. Camera quality is average2. The Ring LED light does remove noise in low light conditionsCons:1. The Ring LED light is non-durable, mine stopped working after 13 days2. The control to reduce light is just beside the web-cam, hence it rests behind the monitor, so every time I adjust the light the web cam setup is disturbed"
2,"I like the image quality, better than the BigPassport webcam I bought earlier. However, this camera design is so poor to use. The LED turns on, and switch to turn on/off the LED is so close to the camera that it will always rest behind the monitor. In order to turn on/off the LED, I have to reach for the nob which is difficult.And also the LED is always on or off, a rotating nob is the only way to control it.Autofocus works, but it's constantly trying to auto-focus even for a slight moment which is so horrible when you are in meetings and the camera tries to autofocus and causes blur effects for a few seconds during the transaction time which is annoying, no face detection. for 1700 rupees I think it's a decent webcam camera with good quality of image and poor design."
5,"I was really surprised with the quality of the photo. Although it said its 2.1MP when I did a webcam check, its giving 3.1MP and also the picture quality is great. The led light has a great impact on the picture which can make us look really good. Highly recommended."
5,Good quality camera and sounds for zoom meeting.
5,"Amezing Picture Quality, Sound Quality is also very good while Video Conferance.Looking attractive with Ring Light feature.I feel very happy to use this Product üòäGiving 5 Star to ZINQ Web Cam üëçüëç"
5,Great auto focus .... Nice Picture quality.
5,I bought this product during great Indian sale and I found product quality is much better at this price. Also ring light works really well.
5,I used the camera as it came but the picture quality and resolution was awkward. When i configured it and adjusted using the driver from website it looks quite good.
5,Easy to connect with computer or laptop. Camera quality is good. In bulid mic

5,Good and appropriate.
4,Good
1,"I made this purchase, to help me get digital jeevan praman, about a year ago. Please note, there is no mention of Radium Box in the description, but you get a reference, on a small slip of paper in the box. Approach them, and they will charge you extra for registration/authentication. You make the payment, and they confirm the registration, but the application won't find it, and they won't help you out. You feel like you've been duped. After all, if this was so necessary, it should have been declared before. And no helping hand.I approached Nitgen too, for independent drivers for possible non-government applications, but even they don't listen. I'm landed with a useless device, a coulple of thosands down the drain.So watch out ! before it's too late."

5,"Namaste!Glad to help others by way of sharing experience with this printer. Got it at a discounted price of ‚Çπ12059 (sbi credit card discount). Its installation was very easy and required no much ado. Its operation too, is very easy and convenient. I'm currently using it for printing study materials from mobile only. The performance is really admirable. Initially gave command to print some PDFs of 2 or 3,4 pages and it printed very fast. Afterwards I willingly downloaded brother plugins and mopria print service which also helped me print smoothly but one day when commanded to print PDFs of pages more than 25, it took very considerable time to respond. I was troubled a little bit but soon, I uninstalled all plugins and operated with the help of android printing service itself. It gave wonderful response. Since then, I'm very happily printing my docs.Now come to its printing quality. It yields high quality printing both in color and mono.Time: In my case, black and white print rate is more than 20 ppm (average) while a color photo took me 12 minutes to print.The best thing for me is that this printer does not annoy you by taking too much time in warming up each time you start this. It instantly becomes ready to print ASAP you turn it on. It automatically cleans the heads. Print, scan and copy quality is the best. Moreover, it is manufactured in the Philippines with no equipments from PRC.I don't have experience of printing through laptop or PC, but I say that this is the best printer for printing purpose. If it is functioning very fast even wirelessly, then what about USB connection? Surely, it will not disappoint you.So kindly go for it.Dhanyawad!"
3,"Big drawback is paper feeding tray,If you want take print two sides , we have to open tray every time , that means for 30 papers we have open the paper feeding tray fifteen timesIf we take multiple prints at a time the papers are getting sticking together ( for that reason we have to open the tray every time if you want o print the two sides of paperI have purchased this for to save the time, but it went in vain because of the paper tray, because of opening the paper tray every"
5,"This is a awesome product by Brother. Newly released with best in class features along with WIFI  capabilities. All in one printer with good print, scan and copy quality. Delivery was on time. Very easy self installation and setup process. Connected seamlessly with Mac and iPhone. I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase."
1,"I purchased brother printer on 30 March 2021. Printer got dead ( not power on) problem 4 times in 6 months,Now company deny to give service during the warranty period. And they says that customer have to pay the repair amount.Although their engineer is not able to find the actual problem of faulty printer.This way I am cheated by Brother India.They are not giving warranty with in warranty period of One year.So please never buy BROTHER PRINTER ."
4,Great product. Print quality is excellent. Easy to setup and very convenient to print over WiFi. Overall ver satisfied with the purchase.Few things which I expected at this price : - ability to print dual side automatically - baclit LCD display. Its an ordinary lcd and very difficult to read in low light.
5,"Well designed printer, works flawlessly with Mac (AirPrint) over Wifi. Print quality is good. Text prints are very fast and photo prints are slow (as expected with any other inkjet printer).Initial setup was easy as mentioned in the setup guide.Wifi configuration was simple, but typing wifi password using 2 arrow keys was time consuming, this would probably be done faster through the app, but the the app for iPhone didn't work, probably because iOS has several restrictions.Printer support manual duplex printing (both sides), where we need to use manual paper feeder to insert the paper, no need to take out tray for manual duplex printing as it was mentioned in some other review.Tried A4 regular prints and 4 X 6 photo prints. Quality looks good.Photo copy is fun and easy, copying ID card for both front and back is really nice and simple."
5,"You will like everything about this printer.Speed,design, No frequent ink cartridge refill, Inexpensive ink.This looks like hero honda of printers.Fill it>Shut it>>Forget it.At least we have someone to challange HP on the costly ink cartridge they have sold till now."
5,I am writing this after 3 months of using this printer. Ideal for home and small office use. Best in this price range. Wi-Fi printing works fine with laptop and mobile. Mobile scanning is one feature which I found very useful for me (directly scan to mobile and send email or Whatsapp).
2,"Quite impressive features, But seems like quality control is in bad shape, received 2 printer in 4 days, both the printer is having the same problem. After 2-3 mins, It displays ""Cannot Print E3"" and there is no resolution to this problem,Thanks to Amazon, Printer is already returned to amazon."
5,Good printer with average print speed and decent print qualityThe USP of this over a canon /Hp is you can store 100-150 sheets of paper in a tray in the printer so you don‚Äôt have to load pages in a tray at the back every time you have to print. it‚Äôs overall space required to operate is also less. The WiFi connectivity is superb. And the setup was very easy.
1,"In addition to my dics level CD device drivers INSTALLS.Requires,Extra charges for subscription modules and  link of online installation suppot drivers downloads to process printouts.Return and replacement must be extra time upto 30 days.The device as to be runed,tuned and tested.Scanner and printing works well.But features as detailed are few.It doesn't work for bulk,book printing.Ideal for multimedia visiting/Invitations sizes cards.One page at time.Makes awesome.Kindly arrange for replacement for other make printer.As 11th march 2021 is too early to test the device,Also inconveinance of brother supports and customer care.And,11th march 2021 being a general festival holiday.I have regerts in buying this device.Its my sincere request and beg your pardon to replace the BROTHER DCPT540W printer."
5,The printer is excellent when it comes to regular text printing. Borderless Color printing and photo printing is good.printing  is fast and the wireless option makes it even more convenient.The printer can be simultaneously connected to PC and WiFi.Printer is available as ‚Äúairprinter‚Äù in iPhone and network printer in android phones and works without any additional app installation when connected to home WiFi.For scanning app is a must on mobile phone. windows 10 and Linux recognises the printer without any issues.Only inconvenience is with no duplex printing. Manually the printed pages have to reversed and fed along with doing an odd/even page printing.Otherwise great option for home & small office use.
5,This is a very good printer and really good for home use..I was really worried that it might be not good but it changed my mind it's really good.. If you are thinking to buy this printer go for itPhoto quality is good
4,"Do not panic or worry when the installation of the printer is done and you receive e3 error. This means mostly the wifi pcb has been disconnected inside because of the delivery handling(happens in most cases). Register your printer through brother website and raise a complaint. The issue will be resolved in a day or two as the customer service person refixes the pcb. This e3 error will not allow you to connect to wifi. So you need to get this rectified. Compared to the prices and quality of HP, canon, Brother seems to be on the better side. Giving it 4 stars because we were unable to use it immediately after delivery. One would want to use a product immediately after they buy and this wasn't the case. Other than this, you can get this printer with your eyes closed"
2,Manual feed is not working properly.
1,"Actually the product is good, but the piece which was delivered to me was detected. And had some hardware issues in the scanner. Bought it from the seller Appario from West Bengal. Unfortunately that was the last piece, so I wasn't able to get an replacement, instead of that received cashback.I bought so many things from this same seller(banglore).I request to take required action on the distributor ( West Bengal), who wasted my time almost a week on a defected piece.But if you have receive perfectly working piece then you are lucky üòâ."
5,"I liked the printer set up, printer speed and print quality even in color and black and white. I used Wi-Fi printing option. It takes lot of time to spool the print. The color printing option takes a lot of time over WiFi probably again due to spooling of data using Wi-Fi. Overall the performance is satisfactory. I have got good quantity of ink left even after regular use. So I guess the default ink would serve 6 months of 'normal' use or more than that. I still got a spare black ink bottle received during purchase. So probably plenty of time left till black and white print color needs replacement."
5,It is a very nice printer. I bought this printer for printing photos mostly. The printing resolution is very nice as the images are very sharp.Also it is very easy to use as it has wifi. You dont need to connect any extra wires apart from power cable. Juat connect the printer to home wifi and give the print command from any device having the brother app. Also you can adjust and edit the pics to some extent on the apps.Loved it.
5,"Am happy with performance and its a great great printer. Does the job pretty well, setting up is easy. I can now print from my phone, pc and laptop. Did not connect the printer cable as its a network printer. Connect printer to your router and the job is done. Good that i bought this."
3,"The colours are not bright, kinda dim print quality.It's hard to navigate, sometimes you need to change/select an option a lot of times to get the required print.Wifi printing works sometimes, but it is handy, though unpredictable.The screen is hard to see."
1,"New Brand, while setting displays cannot print E3. Google search says it is a mechanical malfunction"
3,"The printer was configured and connected to my mac using wifi very easily.It's very slow, to print 1 normal page takes more than 30 seconds, color it takes at least 1 min.To scan also takes at least 1 min sometimes getting hanged while scanningSo, I will say it's easy to use but sometimes very irritating."
5,"A very nice multifunctional printer with miner paper jam problem towards rear of printer inserting paper without experience. That may be eliminated by enserting in proper manner and with experience.... Overall printer is very  nice... Photo clearity is also  better.... So go with this printer, without any hesitation.... Wait the price at lowest approx 13,398 /- rupees..."
3,"Printer is fine to use. But the black print is not black, it has somewhat greyish shade to it, even on ""Best Quality print"". Connectivity and other things weren't a problem, only print quality is of subpar quality."
4,Nice
5,"Every thing about that printer is very good, its printing is also clear and crisp, Only WiFi setup is horrible when it comes to setup through Brother WiFi Utility application to setup WiFi,  Other wise USB setup is straight forward, am  straggling to configure WiFi through Windows 10 Desktop and WiFi - Router and following all the instructions (like Firewall - Off,  Router SSID , Password) but still I was unable to Configure that Printer.  finally I have to Use Direct WiFi which is also some time slow. otherwise printing and other features like Scanning are good."
5,"This is really a very good printer with all the features like WiFi direct, control panel with display, paper tray, good print quality, good build quality etc. in less budget compared to Epson, canon & hp. You can go for it without any hesitation. Thanks to brother."
5,"This is really a very good printer with all the features like WiFi, wifi direct, control panel with display, dual paper tray can be easily manage for manual dual printing purpose, good print quality mono and colour, Photo printing quality on glossy paper is good.For home use and small business useful features copy,scan and print. Good build quality from bbother at this price range really worth buying. I got it at 12300 including 10% cc discount.You can go for it without any hesitation. Thanks to brother and Amazon.."
5,"This one is really worthy printer, you get good quality of prints and also quite economical, though its just a month I bought it can't give an in depth review but just one thing is missing is duplex printing, with its cost quite high company could have included the same. Overall everything is easy to use for this printer and you get good quality too both color and black and white."
4,Build quality us good.Processing speed is too good.Printing speed is normal..The quality of the printer will be fine as long as you use the original ink( applicable on all printers)Overall nice.
5,"One of the best product in this range. I too compared many products. But found this good.Firstly it asked to update the printer, the process to update via app is very simple.And instructions ate simple.Print quality is very good.If you want to take color printout photo, then I would suggedt you to buy kotak photo paper.Rest everythis is good.I too canpare with other brands especially Hp nd erricson.But this is really far far better."
4,"Brother printers is much better than cannon, easy to install. Print quality is super. You get a manual feed slot, integrated paper tray. Easy refill system, and the ink is cheap too. The wireless printing is a lil finicky something otherwise a good product."
5,"Considering the current scenario when we are reluctant in going outside for print outs, this printer serves its job to your utmost satisfaction. Starting from setting up the device to using it, this printer won‚Äôt let you struggle. Please do follow the user manual and you are all set to have printouts. Japan anyways can‚Äôt be beaten in its quality technology."
4,"In general ,happy with the printer for the price and the ink cost ,if Brother could have added ADF (automatic document feeder for  two sided printing ) DCP-T520W should have been the best printer for economical printing  .I think buyers dont mind pay little more  for ADF  feature .Brother do have ADF with other model ,but its only monochrome (no colour) .So brother is one step behind to be the best printer of this range .Hence I rate **** ."
1,The scan of papers is extremely bad and replica of the copy is difficult to read. Lots of lines and dots in the soft copy even after trying over multiple copies. Scanner tends to sway from direction of scanning and requires a person to stabilise the paper with another hand so it‚Äôs difficult to use when trying over multiple papers.
2,"I bought one of these, a decade back, in person from a store. It was great. The one that i got from Amazon, when i tested it..it left oil stains all over the papers i tested it on. Even after a 20 tests, the oil din't stop leaking. Clearly, the seller had a defective old one lying around for a long time, just oiled it, packaged it and gave it away to Amazon."
5,Useful product. Good service given by Tobo
2,"Mobile scan or portable scan are same & no difference,but flat scan are best which is not possible with this device."

5,"I would say this is a much better card scanner than a photo scanner.  Since this is portable and the scanned photo / card / paper moves across the scanner parts, the possibility of scratches are higher, than on a flat bed scanner, where the photo / document to be scanned is kept stationary while the scanner moves.  Therefore, photos tend to get scratched easily, and that gets scanned as well.  Business cards, smaller documents such as small bills are different - and scanning them is easy, and reasonable with resolution.  Strong buy for those with offices where smaller bills need scanning as with cards.  The accompanying card OCR software is quite good."
2,Was amazed by the ease of use but dissapointed by the quality of scan translations. The software does not return a consistent output and data is not very accurately scanned sometimes.
5,Nice
5,Rally nice product and very easy to use. The accompanying software - Prestacko! BizCard 6 - for reading the data takes some knack to get you going though.. but still is very helpful.
1,Worst product I have ever seen when I ordered it first. I received a faulty piece then again I ordered  a replacement which worked for 3 months and again it's not working I request all not to buy products from amazon
5,I was searching this type of 2 in 1 since long timeI am happy at last  i got it from amazonIt is very good product at affordable price
1,The software CD along with the product was damaged and we are not able to use the software to convert the scanned card data to an excel sheet.

4,Haven't used it much but seems to be working fine until now... I have scanned some business cards but still have to try to scan old Photos... A nice feature is that you do not need to connect to a PC for scanning...
5,A very good product if you have loads of old pictures (physical) and are looking to convert them into soft copies. Good buy for me!!!

2,"HP Ink Tank Wireless 415 series.Initially 1 month was good, after two months, no daily usage, printing quality is Pathetic, worst.Money waste was okay but time also wasted my time reslove many printing issues. Such a bad experience.Never recommend you to buy DeskJet, Inkjet, InkTanks printers.Urge you to Buy only LaserJet though those are expensiveü§¨I will through this into trash soon after buying a Good laser jet Printer."
5,"Upgraded from my old HP deskjet with HP 415 All-in-One Tank Wireless Color Printer.The experience so far has been good. Received the printer in good condition with proper packing.The setup process is easy using the manual. As move forward in the setup process, the test pages give you further steps on how to proceed. I liked this approach.I was able to get my laptop, 2 mobiles setup for printing wirelessly in 15-20 min (including downloading of the app and software)The spill proof tech for ink filling is impressive.Print quality is good. The printing over wireless appears to take small delay if you are not using Wi-Fi direct and instead going through the router.I did not check photo printing as yet but should be good for home printing."
5,"The printer came in a nice packaging the delivery was fast and the printer box was all new not opened. The setup was pretty easy if you just follow the instructions given in manual which is provided in the box. The best thing i like about this printer is the print quality, easy to refill ink and the wireless connectivity feature by which you can use your phone to print the photos or files. The printer has both Wi-Fi Direct and simple Wi-Fi network by which you can connect to the printer and you have to download 2 apps which is already there in the play store or the app store."
1,"HP has totally lost the plot when it comes to printers. Quite surprised that a market leader in printing doesn't take printing seriously anymore. This printer doesn't offer basic functionality such as manual two-sided printing.For some strange reason the printer does not print text in the same direction. On every other page the text orientation changes. So if you're printing multiple pages, you will end up wasting time reorienting each page in the correct order.Cancelling a print job on the printer does not cancel the print job! You have to open the print queue on the computer and cancel from there.The HP Smart app on Windows 10 does not show you the ink levels.HP's website is a usability disaster. Broken links everywhere. Cannot easily find the information you need.The website does not offer software versions of the manuals that come with the printer."
2,Always hangs and scanner never worked since installed. when i call the customer service no one responds. and always like  old statments will get back to you sir.  but heck none of them will contact you after that.Not happy with the product.
3,"Support service not good,like other service care hp care call service not open 24/7 it open only 5Pm,secondly its website so complicated,found service center in india but show other country there are more nagetive points,Quality good and for support it is bad so I will give it 3 star only for product"
3,Print quality is just ok not of the level you can print photos.Setup is ok not so easy.Connectivity is very good you can directly print from any device.
2,"I ordered HP415 aio, but the detected software and printer detected by Hp website is as hp410 model.Now i dont understand why packaging box and sticker on printer says 415.Lots of confusion.Its not easy to setup, untill you have deskject or old printer experince.Print quality is ok ok. Dont go by reviews. Better then epson.Better buy simple printer aio. Nothing comes cheap. Its too mess to get things running"
3,"I have used the products for 8 months now, and my short review would be-Although the printer is good for large volume printing at cheap cost, quality wise not very good.Color photo printing is just ok, colors are slightly shifted.Paper jams happen often.Does not handle large documents/many pages well, hangs in between. I replaced the first printer I got after this problem. The replacement model also has same thing,the service guy told me this is the expected quality.HP service is prompt and assuring, but 14k for this? You arr just being fleeced. I got it in sale at around 10k in January, even then I think this is expensive.But cheap printing is definitely my most desirable quality and it does that well."
4,"Printing quality is acceptable but a little bit slow.Look wise good. Connectivity options are also ok.Serves my purpose at home. Need to check in the long run.You need to use this printer regularly (at least once in a month). If you miss, there is 99% chance your header dries out and you end up changing it again and again - this is a big big drawback."
5,"This is a convenient printer that is good for day to day requirements. The print speed is good. It has Wi-Fi connectivity so one can print from computer or mobile without connecting to it through wire (used is already and worked fine). The printing speed is good through Wi-Fi also. It is not being used regularly but off an on so I think it is a good choice if one is not going to use his/her printer regularly. The print quality is good but does not feel best though (sometimes I feel that my old HP 5610 Office-jet had better print quality then this). But as said earlier, this is a good printer for day to day normal requirements."
1,"Horrible product. After printing barely 100 pages, printhead light started blinking indicating some error. Cannot even print black and white when the color printhead light is blinking. Do not waste money on this product."
4,"I got this printer on Sept 2020. I was delivered within 2 days of ordering.Pros1) Pretty compact and good packaging as it was delivered.2) The instructions of setting up the printer was super clear and I was able to set it up in 15 mins.3) Wireless function is seamless, especially the WiFi direct feature. I have printed 50 pages till now without even using the usb cable once.4) Connectivity with Macbook was super convenient.Cons1) Print speed is average and takes more time as compared to a laserjet2) Print quality is above average. But could be better for this price point."
1,"Be Ready To face worst Hp Customer Services. No cal for the installation despite for requesting.and every time u will hear someone will call you back . an that day will never come .and when u have call the customer service they will disconnect the call on ur face ..took a very bad decision going with Ho. there was many other Brands,so please be careful and chose wisely.Thank you"
5,Not easy to install. Nice print quality. I just viewed a video of its unboxing while installing. Value for money. Best part is the low cost printing. It costs 10 paise for black nd white 18 paise for colourr. Its an one time investment just pay around 12k and relax for months without thinking about refilling. It is far cheaper than those inkjet printers. I previously bought hp 3635 and it costed around ‚Çπ10 for black nd white that is 100 times of 10paise.
5,I have been using it for more than 2 weeks. It's compact and user friendly. There are youtube videos available which will guide you in case of any clarification. This made the installation very easy. I have a good experience so far.
5,Good product for home use. Easy functions but need time to configure wireless configuration
5,"I received the product from Amazon on the proper date and the product is working properly. Print quality is good. Easy to install and print cost is low.But the device which I received, that is 13 months old and that product is having only 7 months warranty remaining. After multiple contact with HP customer care through emails and phone calls - nothing changed. So when you are receiving the product, please validate the manufacturing or import date."
4,"Product become very good and install become simple in windows (Hp Smart App).1. print become good quality2. product looking simple3. refill quickly dry ...................... need low costFinally i don't know the quality of photo print, because i never try it ..........."
1,I bought it 4 months back and now it is sitting idle. It won't print more than 10 pages once as paper jams and won't work again. Hp customer service is a joke. It is much better to choose other company than hp and suffer. Totally disappointed
1,Received damaged product colour print head nor working out of the Box
2,Performance is very very poor comparing it's look. Everytime start the printer and facing glitches. So complicated software that needs software engineer at home. No one can get a print out in first attempt. Too much user unfriendly.
2,"Bit disappointed with print quality. The default printing mode NORMAL giving actually bad quality printouts. The previous printer F4288 was a beautiful one, I now think. Need to contact HP support and see what solution they propose."
3,I ordered hp 415 all-in-one tank printer even i got. And on front hp 415 printer tag also there but when i check detail in printer its show its hp 410 .its ok its working fine .thanks for this but do not cheat other people by send different projects
5,"Print quality is good, however the colour of the print is slightly dull compared to the original. Installation is easy. We have number of videos available in youtube demonstrating the installation."
4,Need help to install wifi printing from laptop and mobile .
1,"Being HP, it's made in China , The quality of the product seems to be duplicate and very poor , would suggest not to buy"
1,"Printer performance is too slow, more than 5mins per single page black and white print. I will suggest not to buy this product"
5,Its very easy to setup and use daily. Wifi feature is saves time.
5,Nice print quality at right price
4,Wireless printing is slow
1,HP has made printer setup difficultJunk product stopped working after single print and customer are left scratching head to get it fixed
5,Good product. As per brochure origin country was Swiss. But it doesn‚Äôt look like from Swiss. May be China. Very light and delicate . But printing is good. I feel easy operation with Iphone than android.  Price is little high for 15k.Essential for home and home office
4,Too early to comment.Used only once after installing it.Scanning and printing seems ok.
5,It's good to have these around. You never know when you might need replacements. This is the standard nozzle which you get with your printer.
5,Don't Go With Negative Review .. Awesome NozzleDon't know why people are giving negative reviews. All nozzles are pretty clean.
1,"This nozzle gives my printer a lot of stringing shown by the test tower on the Right. I replaced the nozzle with the one which came with the hotend, the results are shown by the tower on the left.24Pcs wasted."
5,High quality nozzles . I used in ender 3 proAwesome results üëç
5,Nice
1,Very poor printing quality
2,"I m writing this review fter using the 'Quantum QHM7307 Mini Keyboard' for lmost three months. s you cn see for yourself, some lphbet keys hve stopped working in the lst three months. So tht speks for the qulity.The keybord mkes lot of noise while typing nd it is not smooth. The 'Print Screen' key is missing.  I will not recommend this product. Now  I hve to tke the keybord to the service centre for repir.Feb 13, 2020Update: After using it for three months, few keys were stopped working. When I contacted the seller, they asked me to get in touch with the company (Quantam) directly who in turn directed me to their service centre for repair. Since the product was under warranty, they replaced the keyboard. Thank you so much.Mar 11, 2020"
1,"I had ordered for a replacement and they sent me a surprise. :) Both times I received a opened unit.The Good :-  Small sizeThe Bad:- 1. Poor material, 2. Loose dancing like keys specially the spacebar, 3. Small Arrow keysLast but not the least I don't know why I made so many typing mistake using the keyboard, two keys are pressed together many a times. And this could be my issue as well."
4,"I'm using this product for quite a while, and it stands right.# small and portable.# full function key strip.#durable.# some what splash proof.There is not much to talk about it works and acts as the alternative keyboard.But there is no dedicated number pad on this.Overall the product is feel average and works well."
1,"Plz READ BEFORE BUYING!!!I tried to use it by plugging in and when I start typing, it starts to open pages, random tabs in chrome, downloading anything on any website. Jumping through the whole system without getting a single key out from the keyboard. Like u type ok = it will download chrome websites or open any kind of tabs.  After I unplugged the keyboard. My system got hangged, I had to restart and force stop the keyboard driver then it starts to work normally. It's such a troublemaker, I was nearly loosing my system. SO BEWARE FROM THIS PRODUCT!! IM BETTER OFF WITH OLD LOGITECH KEYBOARD! u were killing my system, the hell's up with that ???"
5,Every aspect is Good including it's size .It is a True Value for Money . Very comfortable to press keys.
5,The main purpose for buying this keyboard was to destory this through hardcore gaming. The reason for selecting this one is  it's small size and light weight which is quite suited for my gaming laptop and my workspace and also that i can carry it where i want.And also the package was not so good... it's worst!!ProS:1. It is cheal if the current one destoryed you can go for  another one with out worries.2. It's small when compared with other keyboards at this rate.3. The keys are quite clicky and recognisable.4. Weight is Light as feather.5. Nice and good key spacing.ConS:1. Build feels quite local and not so good.2. USB Cord is not braided and reasonably long.3. Should be handled with care.Conclusion: If you want an secondary keyboard so that you don't want to spoil your precious laptop keyboard sure you can go for it. And also it light and small and looks great. But it will not be durable however it's acceptable due to its low cost!!.
4,"Its a good product, but a little bit smaller than what I expected. The key however, are more in height so one need to put some effort to press the key. This may be because in the laptop we use chick-let key board that has keys with lower height. However, after a while the fingers get used to it. I used it a few times. The keyboard is actually quite a value for money and easy going. Good product to be used in crucial times when your laptop or computer is kept at a distance and you want to type...............this keyboard really has a long lead.After a few months of use now, I can state that the product is an ""excellent"" product.Its helping me a lot because I can keep laptop at a distance and use this keyboard to type.Key pressing is ""smoother"" now after recurrent uses.I am satisfied.ThanksThanks"
5,"This is a fantastic external keyboard. It's softer and smoother than my Vaio and HP laptop built-in keyboards, and as good as my Dell Inspiron keyboard. I've used Frontech external keyboard last 6 months and its keys are so hard & get stuck that I needed to type with such a force, which left me with extreme pain in shoulders and arms!But this one is a Godsent to me - it's just feather-touch!"
5,Really super compact keyboard. Buttons are smooth and comparably equal quality of Logitech.
3,"Summary: Overall, it's an okay keyboard that allows you to get the work done. But be ready to sacrifice on the productivity, since it doesn't feel ""at home"" to use.Details:SIZE: is almost same as 15.6 inch laptops' main keyboard. I will attach some photos later. I kept mistyping and had to go back to correct everything. Looking down at the keyboard while typing helped and I was able to type without errors, albeit at a reduced rate. Quite obviously, keys are spaced differently than on a standard 15.6 inch notebook keyboard. One of the photos I have attached shows its size compared to a HP 15.6 inch notebook keyboard.Typing experience: It's not as good as silent notebook's buttery smooth built-in keyboard, but that is to be expected at this price point. I wouldn't say the typing experience is terrible (considering the price), but a little smoother keys could make things better. The keys on this are good but slightly ""felt"" despite being noiseless. This review is primarily typed on this keyboard itself, though I had to correct it quite often.Key layout: The main keyboard is almost perfect, but many other keys are hard to use (assigned non-standard functions). Listing them all here would not be possible but I can highlight some. Many of the keys such as F11, F12 behave entirely differently than on the notebook keyboard. The same story for most other Fn Keys. That's the story at least compared to a HP notebook running Linux. The experience may be slightly better with other notebooks/OSes but some inconvenience/learning curve is guaranteed.Some reviews that complained about ""mistyping"" are actually a misunderstanding on the part of the user. Actually, by default the ""Num Lock"" state in ""ON"". Which means that some keys on the main keyboard are designed to type numerals by default rather than the alphabet. Though a little documentation could have helped, but as usual with low priced China made stuff, this comes with no documentation.Default keys typed:qwerty456-asdfgh123zxcvbn0Same keys typed with Num Lock turned off:qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnmMultimedia keys: Only 3 multimedia keys worked for me: MUTE, VOLUME UP, VOLUME DOWN. None of the other multimedia keys worked for me.Key press order: is slightly different from built-in keyboard. For example: To effect a <Ctrl+End> you must type in <Ctrl+Fn+Right Arrow>. If you change the order it will be treated as <Fn+Right Arrow> ignoring the <Ctrl> key.The keyboard I was sent was was soiled, scuffed, dirty. Sending back for replacement.At its usual price (Rs 400-500) it's expensive. It's fair price should be under Rs 300."
5,"it creates short circuit to the computer and that leads to ""no signal"" error. this is very strange issue i faced. i struggled alot to find out root cause, whenever i switched on it go to ""no signal"" error and shutdown. i tried change the monitor, motherboard, vga port and hdmi port, graphics card port etc., finally found that no signal issue due to this key board. worst...other users also faced the same issue, check in reviews."
3,"What I loved about this keyboard is the small size & the fact that I could carry it anywhere and everywhere. After a month or two of using it almost daily though, the wire connecting the keyboard to the laptop/ PC has come off and the keyboard isn't useable anymore. I don't know if it's a quality issue overall or with my particular piece but the keyboard is just useless now.I feel sad and sorry that it happened. Till the time it worked though, it worked flawlessly. It was comfortable to use for hours and was so easy to carry around. Sad that it's of no use anymore. üòî"
3,"This is great while it works. It's flat chiclet, very light, very small, and can fit into tight spaces. Doesn't require battery. The chiclet prevents wear on your fingers from going up and down, so it has some ergonomic advantages. Those are the good points.It's not great ergonomically, as it's very small (forces your hands/arms together unnaturally). Having a split keyboard that allows your arms to be their natural distance apart all day is better.Bigger deal - after 18 months, this stopped working. Keyboard press generated wrong/random character. This has no batteries and a different cable didn't fix it; nothing I can do with it. I have similar keyboard from multiple vendors (Artek, Quantum) which stopped working and failed in similar fashion after same period of time. Can't help thinking they're OEMing the same board. Very weird."
5,My laptop keyboard stopped working due to liquid spillage and replacement was not worth it. So I went in for a mini keyboard.  This one is the best.  It is compact as well as comfortable to use.  Does not have numeric keybad as in standard 101 key PC keyboard but that is not required and that would increase width. Good buy. Working fine since last few months.
5,It's a good keyboard. Easy to type. It's a bit small so some people might find it uncomfortable. But i liked it ... Can keep it on any surface even on the bed. The wire is just the correct length for meJust another update ... I spilled paisam on the keybaord and it still works without any issues
4,"Compact design. Works fine but the keys are noisy. Cable length is fine, quality is okay according to price."
1,"why is quantum manufacturing such unbelievably sub standard product pls . pls live up to your equity  in the market folks, this is just not acceptable  Quantum & it doesnt allow me to write this review as well & starts typing all the special characters on its own. serious driver issues pls fix it asap , else pls dont sell  fool around consumers pls, my earnest submission to quantum"
4,"Bought this keyboard a month or so ago. I was a bit skeptical before buying. However the product is good.It is compact in size and the feel of the keys on the keyboard is also good. It's a bit bouncy and spongy, not very clicky kind of. If you like that kind of feel, you will like this keyboard.At this price point you cannot really complain. All in all a good budget product."
1,"I am writing this feedback as to when I bought the keyboard on 12th April , today on 30th April the keyboard is typing 6 instead of O and 4 instead of U , not only that 0 key has gone deaf , the keyboard is so unresponsive, this keyboard doesn't even deserve to be sold for the scam it does, it is 350 rupees down the drain.DONT BUY THIS KEYBOARD EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE LAST OPTION YOU HAVE"
5,"This keyboard is really small and light weight...I'm using this for 2days and it's working fine... Although, it doesn't have backlight but the alphabet stickers are glossy so you can see in dark with the help of your monitor light by the reflection...I liked it"
1,"Bought it on 24 January 2021 in Rs349. It is working fine and everything as per description. Mac does not recognise some of the keys in this keyboard though. It may be because, it is non standard sized small keyboard.Keys are smooth, non noisy.Update on 3 October 2021:It worked well for the first few months but then it started to shut down my laptop for some reason, whenever I plugged it in, my laptop went to sleep mode. Checked in other laptop too, it too shut down in 5 minutes plugged in. I want claim warrenty."
5,"Had to return the first one as it was causing driver issues. The replacement has been working quite well for several months now. It's lightweight and has the old school keyboard feel, a good replacement for my broken laptop keyboard. I simply put in on top of the laptop and it fits perfectly because of the small size."
1,DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH. I bought this keyboard a week ago and already started malfunctioning.Keys wont register or they would register a number when clicking an alphabet. I made a replacement request and amzon was quick with that so props to them vut the replacement unit was trash too same issues out of the box .I REPEAT DONT BUY THIS KEYBOARD IT IS ABSOLUTE TRASH
3,"The keyboard is quite small very lightweight. I purchased it because my desk doesn't have space for the full-layout keyboard that I own. This keyboard works well but if you're used to typing at fast speeds, it won't make the cut for you. At times you have to exert extra pressure to make the keys go in and it is slightly noisy. The build quality isn't that great but it does the perfect job for a keyboard that costs 350 bucks."
1,I purchased this keyboard to use on my Laptop as there was a need. The keyboard worked very well for 2 months and after that keys are not working correctly. The keys ;lkj gives a numeric output and there is no way to change it. I have tried to uninstall and re-install the device. I have also tried to disable the ports and use another port. It's not any issue with ports but the keyboard itself. There is no specific drivers for this model on Quantum webpage. There is no option for replacement as well. I am very disappointed :-(
2,"This is not a good product or not a bad product either. For the price, I could use a bit more quality plastic. There is a awful smell come from the keyboard plastic. The keys are not very good, they are mussy and not a very good tactile feedback .on the other hand what you could ask from a 415/- keyboard. For the price point my only issue is the plastic quality and the smell of the plastic. Otherwise it's a good keyboard for it's price point."
3,"Compact but not so friendly as it was for me. As it lacks some of the keys which I have experienced with my previous mini keyboard Technotech.I really don't like ""Fn"" Keys."
5,This is a compact keyboard that I have used almost for a year and is working fine. I am using an keyboard tray and you need a compact keyboard to fit both mouse and keyboard on the tray. It is good ergonomics!
1,"I bought this Keyboard 4 months back  it was light, compact, and easy carry & working fine. After my 4 months of very Moderate usage, keyboard started troubling me when i press 'A' Letter in the keyboard in display it is showing '$' Dollar symbol.I thought it Driver Issue and re installed drivers but there is no use., Again I had connected to another PC But the same issue repeated again.Please Don't go for this Low quality keyboard and waste your Valuable Money !!!!!!!!!"
4,"Keyboard is compact. It does lift up using semi-cylindrical shaped underbody. Keys provide good feedback, does not  require too much pressure and travel distance is nice. (Far better than laptops). But keys do make a noise. They make more noise upon realising than after pressing.(laptops keys are much quieter). So if you are planning to buy it for classes or lectures then it might disturb others. Go for it if you want to crush it for gaming or typing or if you use external monitor. It has number pad integrated with alphabets.Works well with Android phones as well (using type c OTG adapter. Tested with OnePlus 5t in Evernote app. You might need to turn on OTG from mobile settings.)"
1,"This keyboard is handy and comfortable for typing. But The fact is sometimes all buttons not working goodly. If you click one button, it will give you another output and so many characters will be printed. If I had -5 star rating, I would give that.The main fact is when I plugged in the keyboard, my laptop gets turn off. Then I tried with other laptops, same results came again and again. I tried to fix that problem in a different way. But it didn't work. I am writing this product review after using approximately two months.So, I am highly recommending all of you, don't buy this product anymore."
3,"It is the perfect sized keyboard very similar to a Dell laptop keyboard size. However quality leaves a lot to be desired. Keys get stuck and keep repeating and as a result delays the typing experience. Also the keys themselves feel very light weight and flimsy. I am a touch typist and love my Dell / Lenovo laptop keyboards and was hoping for the same although at a lesser price. Unfortunately was disappointed. Also there is no ""return"" option , so have opted for a replacement. will update this review in case the replacement product is a better quality one."
1,"didn't even use it for a month when it started giving problems, the keys don't work properly, key traversal is horrible. I now have zero faith in quantum hi-tech products and I strongly recommend everyone not to buy their products and instead invest more wisely. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
1,"This product didn't meet my expectations, I placed the order and then i have to oreder for replacement but the product didn't work again and then i have to return the product. This is the first time i was not happy with the product. But replacement and return was so smooth Thumps up üëç for the service."
5,"As expected, go ahead and buy. Good one."
3,"I am writing this review after one day of usage. The keyboard is very good specially if you have a small desk but the packing in which it came was very poor, there was no protective foams at all. The keyboard‚Äôs packet was just wrapped in some ordinary thin plastic... I thought the keyboard would be broken on arrival but luckily its not, amazon should look carefully into this. I wanted to give it 5 stars but because of packing I am giving it 3 three stars. Overall the keyboard is good, go for it."
1,"Decent USB Keyboard for occasional useUPDATE - Stopped working after 6 months. Although there is 1 year warranty on paper it is of no use. When i contacted QuantumHiTech was told to find a local service center. The nearest one is 15kms away and when i was visited was told we are not accepting any warranty items today and i should plan to revisit after 2 - 3 days. I checked if there is an option to send my courier due to covid travel restrictions but was told there isn't any such option, which to me means atleast 3 - 4 visits to service center."
1,Worstest purchase I ever did. It stopped working within 2 days and the customer care service of the brand is really bad they just randomly said a name of a service center and the service Center doesn't even repair keyboard. They just denied. The brand is keep me waiting for 2 weeks. Now also they don't have any answer just ask to wait will inform later....if you don't have good service facility stop sales through out India just focus on your street
3,"ProsGreat price point. Does the job well.Compact size.ConsWithin a few weeks, you'll find loose contact in usb port. You have to frequently adjust the usb plug. Becomes a big pain. I'm planning to buy a wireless keyboard instead.While sound made by keys is not bad, definitely not a ""quiet keyboard"".Overall, okaish product. But as I said, at this price range, don't expect more."
3,|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  I have no words because It is very impressive and I like it  |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
5,The design of the keyboard is very stylish. It has soft keys for smooth and effortless typing. The small shortcut keys beside the keyboard makes it a complete keyboard in a budget range.
1,"this was my first and last amkette product.. very very poor quality. many keys stopped working after 10-15 days, now it is completely useless for me. and customer support is also very bad."
3,"Hardcore gamer here, the W key started fading after 2 months of use.2-3 big sized key(Num + and Tab) needs pressure for output.On the positive side, The design is good and stylish and weight properly distributed.Once it becomes adjusted you can type really fast if that's only your priority go for it."
5,"It is a very good keyboard in the ‚Çπ350-range. Keys are moderately soft, and is comfortable & quiet for normal typing. The multimedia keys are all working properly. Not much rugged design (but not that loose either) , but of course, in this price range, you can't expect much, but you are getting a decent one ! Also, packaging was decent. MUST BUY FOR NORMAL TO MODERATE USAGE. ALTHOUGH FOR HIGH INTENSIVE GAMING, THIS MAY NOT SUFFICE."
4,"It's been around 10 days now that I am using this keyboard. It's kinda okay for it's price, nothing great nor anything bad. Though it could have been better. The plastic that is used here feels kinda cheap and hard hitters can type twice the same letters that they are tryna type. Feels extremely light in weight so it doesn't give you a sense of great quality in this keyboard. Though design wise it looks good atleast from a distance. Keys are extra smooth so they don't feel forced on this keyboard which is a good thing but can be bad too if you are typing rapidly because you would end up typing the letter twice and then you would have to go back and delete it. Though it's a fair attempt to provide a fancy looking keyboard at this price, so it's alright not a bad keyboard. It serves the purpose and that's enough."
1,"The look attracted me ..So I took a chance and went a head to get this product.. but was disappointed with the build quality of the product, plastic is very delicate and can be easily broken... I'm not sure if it's leak proof as I take care of it very much also gaming i haven't tried ... So only build quality is the concerned point here.. Typing is really soft"
1,"I owned it for a while, never had much use till lockdown and wfh.. This is a very bad keyboard for working.. Has to edit each line to remove repeated letters after typing. There is a 10 percentage probably that one key press types it twice.. that means every line in an email will have 3 repeated letters.. So painful..  Also it's a flat keyboard. Nothing special in ergonomics regard."
4,"I ordered this keyboard as my long running logitech keyboard gave up. I have never been fan of Amkette products considering their cheap quality.However I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The keyboard has got separate multimedia buttons on the right side and quick access keys on the left. The WASD keys and arrow keys are marked in orange which gives it a gaming keyboard look. The keys are very soft to type and are precise to strokes.Overall a value for money product with good ergonomics, fast typing and casual gaming."
1,"I am not a gamer. I needed a Keyboard for software development, I bought this on 21st May 2020. Reviewig o : 07th July 2020.Pros:The keys are butter smooth. I liked it very much.Cons:10 days ago, the PageUp button stopped working.Now B and N keys are not working. Either I eed to press hard or it will get typed with multiple characters.So, If you wat a reliale keyboard. Thik wisely and get a etter oe.Puzzle: Add N or B in the unrecognizable words in this post. I typed this sentence from my laptop, hence it is readable. The rest are typed using the this Keyboard.While writig this review,  the Left Arrow key stopped fuctioig."
5,The keyboard is quiet sturdy at this low cost for just Rs279. Been using it for 6+ months and its still going great. Its keys are not hard nor too soft. No ghosting at all. Keyboard multi function button on both sides edge (orange) are working exactly shown.  its a full fledge keyboard in compact size.  Its just plug and play no cd or installation needed.Con I would say has a usb wire which is a bit short than normal keyboards if its for desktop.Honestly i was sceptical about this keyboard at that price but I went ahead and purchased it and now I am HAPPY that I made the right choice. You can go ahead too if you dont want to spend more for HP or dell keyboard which has less functions and those all the things which this keyboard does .
2,So I ordered this product under a lightning deal but due to my bad luck some keys were not working in the keyboardI asked amazon for a replacement and they replaced the keyboardAgain some weren‚Äôt workingI took refund of the keyboardStory endsNow from my experience you should definitely not invest in this cheap productYou can go for amazon choice keyboard or any other branded keyboard like HP or Dell
2,my experience was bad with this keyboard.Received the keyboard first time stopped working in few days.Then request for replacement second time got broken keyboard hence i returned the second time and finally got a refund.Mainly the keyboard size is short too.Go for Logitech or dell by paying extra 200 rs which actually worth
5,"Product is good, After recieving the product I felt it's little bit small.But the keys are smooth.Length is 18.5 inchBreadth is 6.5 inchUnwanted extension given below the space bar. Key texture and print are good.Cable quality is also above average.The media and special keys at the sides are super. At first they didn't work but after restart they are working fine for windows 10 OS. It has around 13 holes to remove dust dust and liquid spills from bottom. It has 17 screws to open the back cover.Completely plastic body"
1,Dont buy this keyboard ...its filmsy plastic ....keys are going to break in weeks ... my previous keyboard was iball ..it worked up to 6 years...  I have a amketee wirless keyboard which keys are fine ... ( security issue is there in wirless keyboards)  so i try to purchase this amkette keyboard ... I will buy iball keyboard from shop ...I lost my money anyway
5,"Writing this review almost after a months of use.I must say it is a good purchase for me. In this price range this is a very good product. Not very much sturdy, but enough rigid as per price. Does not have premium look. Typing is good. Not issues with typing. I also tried gaming with this keyboard. I played pubg with it. It does not have sticky key issue. More than 3 key roll over is possible. But it feels that the key are harder in terms of gaming. You should not expect it as a gaming keyboard cause it's at least 1/10th of price compared to proper gaming keyboard. So I'll rate it a five star considering it's price."
5,"The buttons are very smooth and soft to touch and the multimedia buttons eases up our work.Only drawback i saw till now is that maybe the buttons are not very mch durable for a long use i guess.It's been 4 months i'm using this and didn't noticed any problem bt the keys durability.Some mostly used common keys FOR e.g :- M key for opening MAPS in games gives little different feel when pressed.So, ive removed the button and adjusted the material inside button to the centre and placed the key back in hoping to regain that old smoothness and surprisingly it got smooth again.That's it ....other than this key thing, which is also not a big deal and on the basis of that you can't judge this keyboard.In this price Range this Keyboard works like a CHARM****"
2,"I bought this keyboard for ergonomics, primarily, the functional and easy to reach multimedia buttons on the right and the left..I am a designer and I listen to music 90% of the time that I am working on my computer. The volume up and down, forward, backward, pause/play buttons on the right and the mute, calc, folder, home and email buttons on the left are extremely useful to me and very easy and quick to reach and use.The material and build quality of the keyboard however sucks. I think it's been a month since I bought it and several keys started popping out and falling off within a couple of weeks. I have to push them back in place every now and then. I am not sure but I think there have been a couple of instances of double key strikes/mis-trikes etc. I don't think this keyboard is gonna last very long.The design is beautiful however and I wonder from whom Amkette rippled it off...oh okay ..they ripped it off from Foxin, coz I have owned an identical keyboard from Foxin which was cheaper and better built though not excellent ..Foxin might have ripped the design off from some other brand as well ..who knows ..or they both purchase from cheap third parties ... I've attached pics of the Amkette and the Foxin side by side for reference...."
5,The keyboard is just awesome. The keys are smooth and doesn't make any noise. While gaming also it feels nice. Most keyboards at this price range starts getting stiff keys and all but even after rough and rash use its still smooth and noise free. The only demerit is the keys cannot be removed or cannot be interchanged. Apart from that everything is super.
3,"When I got the product, the escape key wasn't working, after some this it did work, but still stops in between. I wouldn't recommend the product if you are going to use it for typing since the enter key is weirdly shaped and I not reachable when you are touch typing.The only thing I liked about the product was the color. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,"This key board is very good in a reasonable rate. Also it has media player controlling option and all most silent keyboard.It can  be improved more by placing some very small white LED bulbs along the four corners , two at tops and one near up/ down arrow sign, inbuilt.Then it could be operated in dark room , when students studying but his/ her parents are sleeping in same room, so it could have been a newest type of key board in the market."
1,"This was my first Amkette product and I was in a desperate need of a keyboard given the WFH scenario. I usually read a lot of reviews before going in for a purchase and to be honest I did do a bit a research on this purchase as well. However, given the urgency, I probably cut a few corners in my product research. And I am suffering the consequences of it.Coming to the problem at hand, the first key to give up was the Shift. Then, after a few days 9,6 and 3 on the numpad gave up. I am at a point now wherein I get gifts in the form of a new key giving up every day.Can you imagine the horror, for someone who works in the IT industry, of not having a properly functioning keyboard. I am throwing this one out the day my new keyboard arrives."
3,"Specifically bought this one for gaming as dont want to ruin my laptop keyboard.The keyboard is decent in terms of build quality. Ive played COD,CS,FARCRY titles without any issues.The only problem i feel is, you have to press the keys hard while typing unlike other branded keyboards like dell,hp etc.The shorcut keys for volume, previous,next etc really help while watching videos. However plz be careful as they get accidentally pressed while you lift the keyboard for some reason while gaming or watching a video."
5,Really satisfied with the keyboard. It's best in the market. Way better than zebronics multimedia keyboard. Multimedia keys are very helpful and are placed better. Keys are soft and keyboard is strong. Everything seems good. Note:- And i'm never buying zebronics keyboard again. Stopped working in just one week and service is very bad.
5,"If you're looking for a good trustworthy keyboard at this price range, look no further. You can easily go with this option.Have been using this for around 3 months now and it's serving its purpose just fine. Plus the ergonomics are really good and the multimedia keys are a blessing. The multimedia keys are one the main reasons I bought this.However, if you're looking for hard-core gaming, I don't think this product is for the long haul. You'll be able to play comfortably but for me and some other users as well, one or two keys might get stuck at times; has already started happening with me with the Shift key so this is one of its disadvantages. Not an absolute deal breaker though cause you can't expect more than this at this price range.It feels like a premium product and I remember this company Amkette making floppy disks during my childhood so yeah another good point.A definite buy at this price range!"
4,"Writing this review 2 years after the purchase..Pros:Seems to work fine even after a period of 2 years. No problem with key functionality and super smooth as well as silent. Compact design . A big advantage, it has a separate key for controlling sound/music etc. More than worth the priceConsNote that I've been using the product for 2yearsKeyboard is not for hardcore gaming or games which includes multi keys to be pressed at the same time. Ghost key count is less. The print seems to fade if same keys have been used continuously..refer pics uploaded."
5,"I am basically practising Touch Typing for a long but this keyboard helped me score the top speed easily.The first Impression>>>Pros:>Keys are really soft and spacing between keys are low because of that it is easy to reach on every key easily.>Utility Keys on both sides of the keyboard is so helpful and accurate.>Light Weight (May be due to  plastic build but I didn't feel that as low quality)>Height of the keyboard is less (compared to previous keyboards I had used) because of that it is easy to reach numbers and function keys(F1, F2....).> SilentCons:> Utility keys on both sides are of Rubber finish and sometimes it feels little stiff(just a little). But it doesn't matter much because the response is really so accurate and fast.> Size of ""Enter"" key seems a little bit small compared to other keyboards because of that my pinky fingers need to be stretched a little more while touch typing.Overall worthy for this price range."
4,"This is the best keyboard for typing. Even though the materials look cheap and feel cheap its really comfortable for those people who type alot in the computer. I dont recommend this for hardcore gaming coz at sometimes the keyboard just stops working for a few seconds. If you are playing some causal games then its good. And again for typers this is the best keyboard, once you get used to it you can type really well."
5,"Do not expect a very high quality keyboard at this price. However if you just looking for office purpose, mails , multimedia use. Its a very good option since it does have extra keys for multimedia too. Looks a bit flimsy but hey the price is cheap..comes with warranty of 1 year. For gamers I will say go with something more robust and strong.if you can buy a gaming laptop or desktop then definitely you can save more to get a high level keyboard too."
3,"I ordered this keyboard back in june 2019. Within a year my numerical keys above the alphabet keys stopped working. And recently the shift keys and some of the other special character keys have also stopped working. For the price it is worth it if you are in a pinch and need a new keyboard, like I did. But I would recommend against getting it as a gaming keyboard or hoping that with will last for years."
4,"I wanted it for my laptop as working on keyboard is easy. Coming to quality, it feels flimsy, key strokes do not bring confidence of a good quality product, feels like they may come out in few months usage. This is definitely not made for heavy keyboard users (those writing long reports or work extensively on Excel sheets). The shortcut keys for volume, calculator, hard drive, email client, desktop, etc are very handy and useful"
5,"Liked the shortcut true the most.Opening the mail, calculator,browser, file manager has become very easy with it.Along with this the media playback controls are also awesome.Typing experience is very satisfying with noiseless keys .Keyboard has many holes at the backside that helps to drain water if some thing spills on it without damaging the keyboard.The rubber padding on the lower end of the keyboard isn't sufficient. Due to which it slightly slips on the table while typing. Although it is a good product"
3,"Overall good and functional but build quality is flimsy. The image is a bit misleading in terms of build quality. Not gamed yet, but all keys are working. Note that the ‚Çπ key will work with English India pack only. Its pretty good if you tend to work or play in total darkness but don't have the budget for a good quality backlit board. The plastic used is so cheap and feeble that even normal typing bends the board."
5,"For a price of Rs. 400, Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard is truly good to use. Keys feel comfortable to hit or to push down upon softly. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Recently, a new version of it having UV coating and splash proof design has been launched under the label Amkette Xcite Neo Wired USB Keyboard. It looks more sober and elegantly laid out now!"
4,"I have bought this for ‚Çπ300 when I wanted a super cheap keyboard for gaming on laptop.I used this everyday for 1 year 10 months until very recently when the cable at the keyboard joint broke and became unusable.It is very lightweight and ergonomic. It is often advertised as water-proof which I have tested but then again how often do you swim with a keyboard üòÇ. Keyboard still looks good despite such heavy gaming use and the added buttons on its sides were very useful. For gaming particularly, I didn't see any added advantage nor was I expecting any either. I just needed a cheap keyboard for gaming so that my laptop keyboard did not wear out early because of gaming.I am slightly disappointed now it has become non-functional but it was very cheap and I had zero long term expectations."
1,"If you really want low budget Keyboard please go for zebronics or quantum.. I would recommend Logitech or TVS if you dont have budget idea. As I have a PS/2 Logitech keyboard for 13 years till now working well.For budget dont go for Amkette...I bought it for 275 thinking i saved money a lot. But It stopped working after 1.5 year but i  used that very very rarely..Most of the time it was unplugged and idle and untouched..So i cannot claim warranty .So i opened the keyboard and i was shocked there is only a tiny low quality toy microcontroller chip which will easily stop working if we drop the toy..Just like that of you drop the keyboard , there is high chance that it will stop work .I have dropped the logitech literally so many times but still it is working good. The quality is so so poor that the real manufacturing value of the amkette keyboard will not exceed hundred ruppess... The chip , soldering is so low quality .and low standard... Dont buy this keyborad if it is beyond 250rs.. And dont buy this if you have chances of dropping it.. The usb voltage fluctuation if occurred might also affect the chip very easily.. Go for branded please... Now the useless keyborad is used as a toy for kids to teach alphabets and learning keyboard without computer.. Thanks.."
5,"Lets just rate the entire procedure.(Based on 3 day experience)1.Delivery-Like always ..way before the stipulated date.10/102.Packing - Excellent. On addition to the Carton coverage the keyboard was wrapped in bubble wraps. So 10/103. Product- Sleepy, Ergonomic, & perfect for any purpose. The product was exactly as per the specifications. Little bulky but still manageable. The 10 shortcut key on the sides are a blessing! It fits perfectly for my work needs with volume,track controls, Calculator, MailSo if you managed to read all this , I would say go for it before it runs outEdited (01-02-2021)Never expected to be writing this, but the item has stopped functioning. Literally Nada. Nothing works. Except for the occasional luck-based one timer when it works. Otherwise just an unproductive expense. Infact this worked only for like 3-4 weeks , enough time to relieve Amazon for refund or exchange liablities. So I guess the rating for me then comes down to a mere 3 /10"
1,"Its a Total wastage of money and time. Pls DONT BUY this kryboard. Instead buy 300 rs standard keyboard that is far far better than this costlier. If you are looking for typing practice through this keybord then reconsider your idea. I have to return it within w days and i bought Dell branded keyboard that costed me bit more 650 but that is value for money item. Dont waste you time for this type of keyboard. Capslock, numslock, scroll locks mallfunctioning; when you type in speed the many keys characters are repeated and many  are skipped. Its difficult to install this keyboad with laptop. It doesnt install many times. Overall amkette spoiled my time. Wont ever recommend any of their product."
5,"all good , all keys work proper;y expect 3 keys1st shift+2="" ( whenever in keyboard wrote that when you press shift +2 =@) this problem is solve by exchange that both keys but their is not hastage keywhen i press shift + 3 =¬£ this icon comes that was not good for my work and their is not any key which can replaced by '¬£' key.  all are very good infect write this comment with this keyboard .  i use this from 2 or 3 days and this very good. check keys 1st when you recive this thanks for your time .if anyone want to grow their instagram accounty ,youtube channel then contect me  on my IG ID @moonlight_promotions"
5,"This keyboard is good quality and looks reliable as i have been using it without any issue for the past year. But the paint on repetitively used keys may come off after 1 year of use.But in spite of the paint issue, i have ordered the same keyboard again for another computer. I like the smoothness of this and reliability."
3,"delivery before time but packaging was poor.in fact open.so i checked all the keys in itPro:1.multimedia keys2.spill water proof3.gamng look3.lightweightcons:1.plastic quality in little on downside,cheap type. no arms or lap rest proper space2.shut down button should also be included like multimedia keys.i have this feature in my previous foxin keyboard fkm 902."
3,"Read it properly. This keyboard is a great stealth keyboard for typing and normal use but for gaming, it is not suitable. I have had the worst issue. One of the main features for a keyboard mainly for RPG games, the anti-ghost feature is not available here, which means you can not use 3 keys simultaneously while gaming i.e if you sprint using W + SHIFT key then you cannot jump using SPACEBAR or any other key. I have faced it in Assassins creed and PUBG where you have to jump heavily while running. So make proper research before you buy a normal keyboard for gaming. I had no idea about this feature earlier. And as per amazon policy, you can't get a refund, only a replacement. So you will be trapped. Apart from this, it's a good keyboard for typing and normal use."
5,"I bought it for Rs. 450. The printed price is Rs. 649.This is a soft keyboard.Pros-1. The build quality is excellent.2. The keyboard is a soft keyboard. It means that there is no space for the dust to go inside the keyboard. The space between the buttons is filled by the plastic cover. (as shown in the pics).3. It has all the required buttons.4. The number-pad is given at the right side which is an additional advantage.5. The buttons are extremely soft and easy to press.6. The cable is also very good and lengthy. It is around 1.5m long.7. There are two stands provided at the bottom (one at left and one at right). You can use these stands and thus make is somewhat inclined in order make its use more comfortable.8. The lights for Numlock, Capslock, Scroll lock are provided. These light in white color and are quite bright.9. Less chance for dust collection in the keyboard as there is not much space for the dust to go inside.Cons-1. The keyboard is way too soft. If you are a hard keyboard user then initially you'll face some difficulty using it. It may happen quite often that you press any key for on letter and the same letter may get printed more than 2 times. So if you are a traditional keyboard user (hard keyboard user) then you need a few days to get used to it.This is actually not a con because this is somewhat advanced design.2. Somewhat costly. You can get some cheap keyboard in local market but obviously the quality of those is nowhere close to this one.Final comment- If you want to purchase a keyboard for a laptop or PC and if you can afford it, it is the best available choice in the market. Go for it without thinking twice."
1,"I've been using this for a year. The keys were soft when it was new. Over the months, the keys slowly became hard. It was gradual so it was difficult to notice the change until my finger tips started paining and I realised that it's because of the hard keys. This product has around 4.5 rating. I am guessing all have reviewed after purchase and not updated after a year of use!"
3,"This sleekly designed keyboard comes with chiclet styled keys (keys with low height, like on the iMacs or laptops). I went for this design because of the low key height, so that even if they get hard with dust later on, the low height will make it less stressful to press.. The narrow design of the keyboard is good for making it fit in small space. There are small, sleek indicator lights on num/cap/scroll locks.However, on the negative side, the keys double press for fast typists like me. I have to correct a lot of my typing once I am done using this keyboard. Another problem are the media keys that rely on ""function"" keys. You can activate them for the session permanently by pressing a combination of the FN and ESC, but that doesn't remain after restarts, and also makes the actual F9‚ÄìF12 keys secondary.For the cost spent, this is a decent keyboard, but not as great as other reviews make it out to be."
1,"The keyboard is of cheap quality, the cheapness is to the extent of keys getting struck all the time. I am very disappointed for the value I am receiving. I am sure such a cheap quality can't be unnoticeable to users and even getting to think that if Amazon is manipulating user reviews to trick buyers go for products which are not worthy of buying. The review ratings are like a joke now."
1,"Given the Brand's name I bought this keyboard blindly.But I found the keys pretty hard to press on the first day itself. I thought it maybe because it's new and would be easier with time. But to my horror, the keys went becoming hard and hard by the day.Now, after around 1 year of usage, the keys have become too hard to type anything smoothly. Every time I type I have to make sure all the letters are in place. Fingers also have started to pain.WORST EXPERIENCE.GENUINE REVIEW AFTER ALMOST 1 YEAR OF USAGE"
2,"#Design:Noting to say here we can see what is in the picture it's almost same, although I expected little slimmer like my laptop, it is double the height of my laptop keys, (I had added an image for its real comparison)I went for this design because of the low key height, so that it will be less stressful to press.but here comes the twist after use of 2-3 month the ctrl button becomes very hard and it slows down my typing speed,to press the ctrl button, need to press on the centre of the button if you try to click on the corner it will not press even if you put all the pressure you have in your little finger.#Problems I face (issue)1. buttons not slim as expected2. some buttons get very hard which need extra attention while typing.#Openion / Summarydon't buy if you want something slim and soft button to work,No issue if you only want to play games or not a regular user."
5,A very good product. Durable. After using for past 1 year it's still working like the same way it is working at the time it was new . Didn't face any type of problem till now. Very nice product. The key is also good very comfortable during typing.
5,"One of the best keyboards I have ever used. Very good for heavy and extensive daily use. Being used to Macbook keyboard and other keyboards, the different position of CTRL Key, Command key in Mac, Option key and Alt keys....will take some time in getting used to it. Other than that, this is the best quality keyboard with no noise at all, cannot hear typing. Overall Keyboard is compact and small, the main Querty keyboard is the size of 15.6 inch Macbook keyboard, but again not a problem for me. I just hope that this should last longer, next time going to buy the same. A really Dell brand high class product."
5,"This is the best PC keyboard I have used so far. Quick type. Laptop feeling! This chiclet is just so lovely. I am sure this is one of the best keyboard for PC. However, there is one problem. I feel the gaps while typing and this mean keys are not where the keys is normally found. This means when tying R you may type T. Migrating from Laptop keys is the issue because in Laptop there is absolutely no gap. I feel one has imagine the keys a little left and it can be get used to. After two days I am 95% corrected the typing errors without looking at the keyboard. I want to take it to 99% in the next 5-6 days. Ihope my will help those who want to get into the technicalities and details. But yes, it does give ""that laptop feeling"" while pressing them. I think it will be last for more than 5 years even if it is used roughly. You can say ""manhandling"""
5,"The keyboard is very smooth comfortable to operate.Pros:1. Chiclet type keys like laptop.2. Good key layout.3. Very easy to clean with a brush.4. Less sound and feather touch.5. Easy to install, just plug n play.Cons:The keyboard is somewhat long than normal keyboard, some may find it difficult to put in a keyboard tray."
1,"Product is okay considering the price. I am using this keyboard from August, 2021.Today suddenly I am facing a issue of repeated disconnection. I checked all the ports and it is indeed the issue with the keyboard not the mouse or other things.The problem is not the product but the customer support team. Today in general we are seeing improvement in customer support teams for many organizations. In this time, the attitude and the unprofessional behavior of the Dell team was really disappointing.The tone of the customer support representative is like I am the sales person and I am calling Sir Isac Newton in his busy time to disturb. And then the call gets disconnected without solving the problem.I called again. This time a very impatient lady KINDLY picks up the call and asks for the service tag number... I am saying, please 1 minute... she repeats, ""SIR SERVICE TAG NUMBER!!!"" and then again!!! Could you please figure out from the attached picture, anyone can read the service tag number? There should be a S/N mentioned on the label. Anyways, she then says since this not ""stand alone"" product, I have to transfer the call to the concerned team. And then again... some minutes of mysterious ""Yes""... ""hmmm""... and then again call is cut.Importantly, no-one calls back to check if the customer is happy or no feedback request!!!This is a sincere suggestion to Dell senior managers, please pay attention to how your customer support staff interacts with the customers and also how their managers interact with them since they seem very much in pain and stress! If this continues, it will ruin Dell's image very soon!For all others, Amazon customers, I have Emailed Dell since I had no other way to claim my warranty. I'll definitely keep you posted ""IF"" I hear back from them. If not, then I'll make a YouTube video to inform other customers also to spread the word help them save themselves from this mishap."
4,Update:Thank you for the replacement exchange. The replacement keyboard works fine. Does the job well unlike the previously shipped one. All keys working and smooth. So increased the ‚≠ê rating to 4 from 1 as per my previous review as below.Review 2 days agoAt least 5 keys were not working so I have requested a return and replacement. There was no refund option so Awaiting a working product. I will update the review once I receive a replacement keyboard
5,"Got this delivered, couple of days back, well withing time and neatly packed. Its a superb keyboard, have used it quite a lot, in the past 2/3 days and the typing experience has been sublime. The keys are well placed and the build quality is excellent, so should be able stand the test of time. My laptop's keyboard has been acting up a bit so couldn't have asked for a better substitute. Its efficient/comfortable and convenient.Thanks Dell/Amazon!!"
5,"I used it to replace an 8 years old Dell KB 212 that came with my Dell Inspiron 620s. Some of it's keys recently stopped working. Could have been dust or water damage. Now if i wanted, i could get a mechanical keyboard, may be Redgear with brown switches but i really don't think they're worth it as the price difference is just too much. Also, i wanted a compact keyboard similar to my Dell KB 212 and there was no keyboard that was even close to Dell KB 216. So i hurriedly ordered it and to my surprise, it actually feels better and is even smaller than Dell KB 212. Though the biggest change i see is that it's silent which is good and 3 Extra buttons for volume. Highly recommended."
4,"The first time I ordered the keyboard, I received a defective one wherein the down arrow key wasn't working. I promptly applied for an exchange and got my replacement from Amazon without any hassles.It's a great keyboard considering I use it only for programming or writing code. It's not ergonomic but even after using it for 8-10 hours a day, I don't face any issues. I haven't used it for gaming at all.Overall, for plain typing or programming tasks, this is great value for money."
5,"I touch type and that at times results in genetic typing...my earlier keyboard, though not mechanical would make a considerable sound.It was bothering everyone around at office.Also the keyboard was reaching end of life.Also the earlier keyboard was wireless....It would lag at times for no reason and after pressing say 10 or so characters in rapid succession it would kind of hang or seem to ""buffer"" and then all characters would appear at once. The batteries were also depleting frequently...my heavy usage could've been one reason....but...they would deplete in 3 to 4 months...So decided to go for a USB keyboard..I did a lot of research before going for this.. Very happy with the keyboard...It's astonishing quiet, the keys feel good under the fingers...build quality is amazing....Very happy user here."
3,"Just received it. Cheap quality plastic is used. I have been using this same model keyboard from last 4 years(2017), the one i purchased in 2017 has really good quality plastic keys. But since the wire was damaged, i wanted to have same model keyboard, order and got this, now i am disappointed.Dell shouldn't compromise on quality, increase the price, that's fine. I love spacing, layout and size of keys, hope it had good plastic too."
1,"I wanted to replace my aging hp keyboard that came with my computer because keys were getting sticky. Just in a few months the keys of the new keyboard have started getting stuck in pressed position resulting in likeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I have to go back often and delete extra text and unpress the stuck key. This is supposed to be a good basic dell keyboard, but looks like poor quality control"
5,"This is a pretty descent for people who want to do occasional typing. Key travel is good and feedback is okay.But dont get this keyboard for gaming. Lacks anti ghost support meaning you cannot use 3-4 keys at a time which is important in many games.For programmers, look for a mechanical keyboard rather than this."
2,"I'm using this keyboard for the past 1 year. The keys started to stick on the bottom when pressing after 3 months itself. That makes the typing experience annoying all the time. Now also while typing this ""A"" letter stuck (Stay pressed) while pressing.On gaming the problem is really a headache most of the time I don't even know what happens on the game then I came to notice the ""Ctrl"" button is staying pressed. Very Annoying."
2,"It's noisy!Seems flimsy, cheap and plasticky.Not like the keyboard on my Dell laptop in terms of touchThe labelling of the letters is stuck over the plastic keys and it's so evident - feels like it will get worn out very soon - or can get scratched if you have very 'curious nails'.The size and layout seems fine.The look seems elegant and sleek.Overall I am not happy with the quality of this product when it comes to touch (which is important as that's how you use a keyboard!).There are some useful functions like volume keys and so on, but not useful to me personally as I don't use my PC for media at all.I had to buy this as I wasn't getting a DELL wireless keyboard without a mouse - as I had purchased a DELL mouse few months ago - weird restriction from DELL! I was let with no choice other than buying a non-DELL product or an extra mouse or this.Maybe my expectations were high from being a historical HP customer who is used to reasonably quality products? I don't know. So far I'm not pleased with the purchase."
5,"This was bought in 23rd August,2019 and is still working without any issues till date (21st August,2021).I bought it for the slender chiclet keys which are soft enough to be used.The LED for Num lock, Caps lock and Scroll lock are present. But, we would need the Fn key to enable the scroll lock which isn't such a big deal;as I haven't ever used scroll lock in my over 16 years of using PC.The right click button on the left of the right Control key is the one which some keyboards don't have on them. The right click key present here is a life saver when the mouse doesn't work; as I can navigate with keyboard shortcuts alone with expertise."
5,"I am using four keyboards.1. Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro L white LED Cherry MX Blue switches.2. TVS Gold Keyboard with Cherry MX Blue Switches.3. Asus Cerberus gaming keyboard.4. This very keyboard for which I am writing a review.I must say, if you want to do programming, just grab this keyboard with your eyes shut. Superb keyboard. Even if it gets damaged at any point of time, you can certainly buy a new one coz its cheap. Don't get me wrong, This is a durable keyboard. Got comfort for hands, even better than the cooler master's keyboard. I back-light is not a concern, buy this.you can get 11 dell keyboards in price of 1 cooler master masterkeys L pro white led keyboard. I am so happy with this keyboard. The chicklet keys are breeze for typing. I have typed more than 3000 words with this keyboard without fatigue. Just buy it. It's worth every penny."
4,So far so good. Tactile buttons. Surdy looking. No squeaky sounds. Button placements seems good. Overall a nice keyboard. Watch out for lighting deals to save extra
2,"I'm writing this review within first two hours of  delivery.Its not that cool as I thought of a dell product.cons:1)The backspace key don't work as other normal key work .  you have to use two finger to press button with same force or press it hard as you press enter.2)The buttons are not at all smooth to press, you have to put some force.3)The wire quality is not good.4)Made in China"
4,"I am a programmer who types a lot of code each day. Most of the keyboards I have used has faded the key prints.  This is a chiclet keys, easy to type if you are used to laptop keyboards.. Spacing is odd, and even prone to typos.. They keys started getting polished because of the heavy typing. also some keys which i use the most (ctrl, space, a, s, shift, backspace, arrow keys) have started wearing down to bottom. Still the most durable chiclet keyboard I have used. With audio controls, this is the best entry level keyboard.. Still the keys have become noisy..."
1,I don't know whether the seller or Dell is doing bad here. The quality of the keyboard is very poor. The keys are supposed to soft press. But this remembers me of the old typewriter. Keys are very hard. Very poor keyboard. Programmers do not buy this at any cost. I'd be returning this if possible.Nope! no return for this item.
1,"I purchased this item on 25th of November'2020 with one year warranty, I started facing problems in the product from the month of August 2021.Some of its keys were not working. As it was in the warranty period, I tried to call Amazon customer care, after trying to several days I succeeded to contact the customer care. The customer care executive said that complaint had been raised & within 72 hours the seller will call you and will solve your problem as it is in warranty period so seller will replace the item with new one. And very sad to say it is almost 30 days passed neither I received any call from seller nor my item has been replaced. I'm almost 10 years old customer of Amazon but very sad to say Amazon didn't value its customer. I am so much disappointed that I will advise all of my nearest & dearest that don't buy any item from Amazon. And one another & important thing to say that Amazon's customer service is very poor."
5,The ideal keyboard for PC.Easy USB connection.Keys are really smooth to press and well organised.You might find some extra function keys than the old keyboards.The only thing I feel missing is its palm rest which isn't available for separate purchase on Amazon.But haven't faced any significant problems without them though.Overall very good product!
1,The buttons are not bright white as seen in photo. The size of buttons is very small and  it is not silent type key press.. it does not look original product as I use the same dell keyboard in office. It Looks like a cheep Chinese product. But I got it for 560rs. I would not have paid more for this keyboard... after couple of months I will have to buy a better one...
1,"After two days of use, i face the following issue with the keyboard. Many times, when the letter ""e"" and ""o"" pressed even once is typed continuously for 10 to 15 times. I had to press backspace and write again. Very low quality. I could not return and option is only for exchange of exact same item which is even more bad."
3,"I am having problems with this keyboard since it is not standard size. Touch typing is difficult since the fingers land on the wrong key. The key size and key spacing is not standard. The product description did not mention this, although it uses the word ""compact"". I cannot return this also, which is disappointing."
4,"Okay, so I think this is a very good keyboard from dell. But I was looking for a keyboard which looks and works like a laptop. With the keyboard having low-key travel I thought it would work great but it was nowhere close to a laptop's keyboard. very much higher key travel and softer keys instead of chicklet style keys which didn't give that satisfaction of typing for long durations. I would have kept it but the full-size feature of the keyboard worked as a curse for me having typing on the laptop for a long while, I just can't accept a keyboard that big. So unfortunately I have to return it. but the keyboard is great if you are a beginner and you are looking for a keyboard on your PC. I don't think so that any company other makes great keyboard with low key travel so I will probably order something from abroad as after looking in the Indian market, I don't think so that anything can satisfy my needs as of now for the budget I would like to spend on my keyboard.Well that's all for today folks so if any day you're thinking so buy this keyboard having laptop-like feel in mind then please consider something else, other than that you can go ahead and get this one!"
2,"I am writing this after using it for 4 months now. My Dell Latitude is a small sized laptop with which I used to have Logitech keyboard, which was very good but that belonged to the office. Just a week before the official lockdown announcement I started to work from home and that Logitech stayed back in the office. I always wanted to have a chiclet keyboard and ordered this. The Keyboard itself very solidly built, fill points to that. The problem I am facing is that it will stop working after 3-4 hours of use. First you will notice a lag in response and after that it just stops working. I have three other laptops and it behaves the same.  That's the reason for 2 stars."
5,"Hi, I am working from home. I already have a mechanical keyboard. But, it makes hell lot of clicky sounds which gives me headache at times. I was looking for a keyboard which makes near to no sound on clicking. Finally, I zeroed on to this keyboard. And, trust me this keyboard has made me so happy. I liked its chiclet keys. Affordable and soft keys. It is not for gaming purposes but only for normal day-to-day work. Thanks Amazon you are the saviour in this Pandemic.. üíïüíû"
5,"Pros:Compact keyboard, soft touch but there is enough pressure that prevents accidental & very delicate touches from registering a keystroke. Your wpm will really improve after switching to this keyboard from a fully mechanical keyboard.Cons:The space bar could have been a bit more wider and curvy in design. function keys' width could have been more, just like a mechanical keyboard."
4,"Pros :1.Small in size , handy .2.Easy to carry , Overall quality(3.5/5)Cons :1.Buttons are tough ( Will become smooth after long usage hours ).2.Usb port is rough to use"
4,"It's very light weight keyboard and not for professional. The beginner can use this for their small work. The keys are not smooth. Wire length is sufficient for use.The seller send it with no packaging, it delivered with its original box. I get this ‚Çπ315."
5,Button pressed easily
1,"As I Unboxed This ZEB-KM2100, I Found That It Is Made of Plastic That Is Not Durable. A Small Force Applied At Its Ends  Tends It To Bend. Strong Force Is Sure To Break It.Okay, I Understand That I Should Not Expect Durability For The Price I Paid - ‚Çπ290.Its Keys Are Soft. It Is Light Weighted. It Worked Fine For 10 Days. 11 Day, Its 'Soft Keys' Became So Delicate That On Single Keypress, It Types Same Letter Twice (As Shown).Don't Buy It Seeing Its Price, You'll Be Disappointed. Go For Other Reputed Companies Like Dell.If You Doubt My Review (Including Screen Capture), Ignore And Go Ahead Buying It - Happy Buying :)"
1,The keys stop working and don't respond for few minutes. For 5-6 days the keyboard worked very well... But now i m facing such problems. Unsatisfied with this product üôÅüôÅüò†
5,"Review after 1.5 months, this keyboard is awesome, because you can use a new keyboard at such low price, although i bet it wouldn't last more than 6 months of rugged use, but it will run fine till 6-8 months of rugged use, mine came broken (just a little bit of corner), so did everyone else get a broken keyboard nonetheless it's great, it's a great substitute for those ‚Çπ600 dell keyboards which are sturdy(if you can't afford one like me). This keyboard will easily last more than one year on normal use. It's extremely lightweight, compact. Smells like all those other cheap Chinese toys and gadgets do from inside when it's new, the keys are flimsy and after few months of usage you would have to press extremely hard on the keys for it to work. The keys are of extremely cheap quality kept in a socket, but works great, no locking mechanism but keys won't fall off. Overall an excellent keyboard replacement. Works for me I don't know if it works for others or not, don't expect fast inputs from this keyboard, this keyboard even takes about few seconds to connect, so not for gaming obviously."
5,"I am a regular user and I loved it!Reasons:1. The major reason to love this product is it makes no noise! It's quiet. I do not like that 'khat-khat' noise when typing. I am an extremely fast typer and the noise would have become unbearble if it made any! Thank god for that! I was looking for exactly this kind of keyboard.2. The overall size is not too small, neither too big! It is just perfect for personal use.3. I am not a gamer but I hope to use the multimedia keys for watching movies etc. If you are buying this for regular use at uome or as a substitute for your laptop keypad, go for it!"
1,The worst product I have ever seen on amazon. Keyboard was broken at corner. Worst keyboard. I had never written a bad review like this any time before.
1,"Budget keyboard with iPhone 6 features.Offers more than expected.Backspace key works only on 'very hard' press, and other keys work only on 'hard press'.Soft Press is like child-lock. No matter which key you press, nothing happens. Tap the beats of your favorite song while staying assured that not a thing will get typed(except 'L'). You could record the sound of key-presses and play it to get a typewriter effect.The 'L' key has feather touch... You type one 'L' once and you get two extra 'L' printed, absolutely free.The spacebar key has a nice upward slope as you slide your finger from left to right end.Compact, budget friendly. The kind you would find in Cyber Cafe.Guess what, its the ""Zindagi ke sath bhi, Zindagi ke baad bhi"" kind... As you CAN NOT RETURN it.Got it 30mins ago, just realized it has a replace-only warranty.Ordered it for WFH, but it turned out to be utter crap.Keys are so densely packed, and they don't work unless you put in an extra effort.It would be a steal deal for people who do all the typing with one finger only.Rs. 350/- wasted.... Willing to sell it off on OLX in 100rs.@Seller: you may take it back for free and sell it again to someone who might need it.#Peace"
3,Pros+Lowest price.+Full function wired keyboard for personal computer and laptops+ Zebranics brand produces good products at affordable prices.Cons15% smaller than a regular keyboard. Space between keys is less.So I face a little bit of discomfort while typing.Built quality is not up to the mark. Don't expect better quality at this price.The packaging is also not secured. In transportation high chances are there for damage.I can't excuse in proper packaging. Amzon must take care of packaging. Particularly in this product.
4,"Zebronics keyboard which has 12 multimedia keys, easy access to the music within the keyboard, volume up and down buttons are user friendly. It has a special Rupee key symbol which can be easily accessed, the USB cable is also pretty decent connects easily to any kind of computer and laptops."
1,"Not worth for even a single star, Exactly after 2 weeks of buying it, just found that if we have to move the keyboard frequently then for  a while the keyboard stops working due to some wire problem, the connecting usb wire is too hard and it got cracked at the joint of usb and keyboard , i have done jugaad and applied m-seal at the joints to stop wire from cracking more but all in vain as the portion covered is now ok but after that it started cracking again, the design is such that you keep pressing multiple alphabets simultaneously untill you get used to it ."
2,"For me, when this item was delivered, the shipping box seemed all messed up. But that didn't alter my expectations at first.But, this keyboard actually seems like completely old stock inside out. As soon as I took it out of the cover, the left Alt key cap came out üòÇ. Also, the space bar stays pressed. Yes, it is light weight. I did give a replacement request in Amazon, but the keyboard seems to be released a long time ago too. The reason why I'm saying is mainly because of the logo on the Windows Start Key. Microsoft dropped this logo a long time ago with the release of Windows 8. Since then, most of the keyboards which came out feature the new Windows logo on their Start Keys. And all keyboards completely shifted to the new logo with the release of Windows 10. But this one still keeps the old logo. I did notice that the Month and year of import is October 2019 on the box. And I'm writing this review in October itself. That doesn't deter the fact that this might have been released long ago.I bought mine when Amazon was offering this item in a lightning deal of Rs. 209. Anyway, it's hard to expect something more from a keyboard worth Rs. 200. Might have been a good keyboard if the product was fine at least."
1,"IF YOU ARE GAMING ,YOU KNOW  U NEED SHIFT AND CTRL KEYS ALWAYS PRESSED EXAMPLE FOR MINECRAFT AND ASSASSINS , BUT THIS KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOESNT SUPPORT IT , FIRST ORDER THOUGHT ITS MANUFACTURER FAULT AND REPLACED RECEIVED SAME TYPE AGAIN , ALSO INSTALLED DRIVER FROM ZEBRONICS SITE NO LUCK , FINALLY APPLIED REFUND AND ORDERED DIFFERENT KEYBOARD FROM DIFFERENT BRAND . ALSO THERE SOME OTHER ISSUE LIKE IF SPACEBAR PRESSED SOMETIMES IN WINDOWS NOTIFICATION BAR POPS AND MINIMIZES EVERYTHING NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE DOING , SHIFT + W DOESNT STAYS CONTINUES , IF PLAYING ASSASSINS CREED YOUR PLAYER WILL STOP RUN STOP RUN IF SHIFT + W PRESSED , SAME FOR MINECRAFT WITH CTRL + W . DIDNT EXPECTED FROM ZEBRONICS FOR SUCH PATHETIC PRODUCT ."
1,The quality is very bad and its not even solid like usual keyboards. I tried for return but its been upgraded for replacement. I don't understand why this is happening? You must allow customers to return item and give them full refund.
5,Good working condition and received safe and perfect product on time. Keys are smooth and auto installation made easy to access. Would suggest anyone to buy it.
3,"Keyboard quality is not that great, but okay for this price range. The position of the keys are slightly different from other standard keyboards, for example ""backslash"",""home"", ""end"" and ""enter"" key are wrongly positioned. Keyboard is a bit smaller but it is okay for me as long as the keys are properly positioned. It doesn't have a good grip, so we may have to place something underneath the keyboard if you are using a glass table.Bottom line:This may not be suitable for heavy typing or gaming but should be good enough for normal/light work. This can serve as a replacement keyboard for kid's computer as they tend to break the keyboards on regular basis."
5,"With the mark of Zebronics, purchasers need not have to worrry about a thing! The key board nicely fits to my working table, with its size is a little higher than the keyboard size of laptops. Any adult can easily lift and hold the entire keyboard and operate the keys using just the thumbs. If there is one thing that is highly interesting about this product is its chic design and its ideal size. Not to mention its functionality.  I can race my fingers across the keyboard with ease. If you are looking for a soft touch keying, you will be disappointed, but by using for a few days, you will get used to it. The one feature I dislike in this product is the ""home"" button is given below and the ""end"" button is given above. But, this is not an issue because the same keys can be operated in the rightmost portion of the key board, wherein the home button is above and the end button is below."
5,"I have been using this keyboard from more than 3 weeks.The keyboard came in a well mannered package.The best thing about the keyboard is, it is small in size and can be handles easily.All the buttons are working properly. The keyboard comes with a usb cable attached to the keyboard. The cable is neither too long nor too short.I have a lot of writing work to do, hence a lot of typing needs to be done and on these days of using the keyboard; I have not found any issues with the keysI had a lot of mixed emotions before buying this keyboard because the number of negative reviews here is more than positive.But the good this is:1) The delivery was on time.2) Keyboard came in a well packed condition.3) Keys are stable working.4) USB cable is working accurately."
2,"Pros-----> Cheap & expendablecons-----> Stiff keys and they get more stiff after usage of just 10 days.> Worse keyboard when it comes to ergonomics> Enter key is a flipped design which means the bigger portion of the Enter key is on the top portion due to this whenever i hit the enter key my pinky lands on the backward slash key which is very annoying> Key top wobbles a lot which means keys will live only for a short period> Last and the most hated thing about this keyboard is its placement of arrow keys, as shown in the image the arrow keys are not aligned properly so definitely you don't feel like using them a lot."
3,"Overall it is a good product if required for non-critical home use.However, It has been only couple of weeks after I purchased this keyboard, , and few  keys have caught moisture. because of which after pressing those keys, they get stuck inside and doesn't release on their own. So Now  I am having hard time while typing important emails.Pros:1. Cheap cost2. Keys are not NOISY at all.3. Matt finish on the surface saves the keys from fingerprints.4. Sleek design.Cons:1. Poor material as the cost is less, and hence may not have long life.2. Not reliable while using it for critical work."
2,"'Zebronics' Company has carved a good name for it in gadgets & utilities. BUT, this keyboard product is a tragic downfall.The keyboard though is nice in first appearance, has very hard key-presses, which make it a pain to use, and spelling errors start happening as one types because some keys don't get pressed by even pressure of the fingures.In a nut shell, the keyboard is just like a good looking 'toy' instead of being a useful and ergonomic utility.Unless, Zebronics change the base of the keys-- so as to make them work evenly with same fingure pressure, this product is a waste of money for serious utility buyers."
2,"One of the most entry level keyboards. Extremely flimsy material, and should be handled with great care, else this may not last a month. First item delivered had a faulty 'R' key that needed lot more pressure, and an 'A' key which seemed to be somewhat tight in it's key well compared to most other keys, so in case of fast typing 'A' would be missed 4/10 times and 'R' would be missed 9/10 times. USB cable is very thin and flimsy, but not much worse than the keyboard itself. USB cable is about 1.5-2 feet long, so don't expect to be able type at a distance from the computer case. Ordered a replacement.Updated 13-Mar-2021: Some of the keys have become lot less responsive, i.e. I need to hit them several times or very hard for the entry to be recognized. Also at least 2 keys ('A' and 'R') are such that pressing them ones, leads to frequent multiple entries. Suggest staying away from this keyboard!Note that I bought that to use with few servers behind a KVM switch, which will run mostly headless, so the usage would be very very light. For anything more I'd never buy this keyboard, but spend a bit more money."
2,Keys are not at all good and cannot type fast as the keys are shaky. Took it attach it to my laptop for fast typing but didn't met the purpose.
4,"I got this product for INR299. Price to Perform Ratio is decent.I haven't added any pictures but believe me it's a genuine review after 15days of usage.Pros -1 - The price if the keyboard is quite decent. (INR299)2 - Main pros about this keyboard is it's a Full Size Island keyboard.3 - It has big size Left Shift, Left Enter and Right Shift Button.4 - Button Order and placement is also decent.5 - Keystorke and Response is also decent. (At this price can't expect mechanical or semi mechanical like button response).6 - All Button Works wih Windows 10. All multimedia buttons also works.Cons -1 - Weight is not that high. (Don't get me wrong about the sturdyness of the Keyboard.)2 - Doesn't have Palm rest.3 - Cable quality is not that high. *Feels cheap to me.4 - Power consumption is also good on laptop.Let me tell you if you're a fast typer or if you have work which needs fast typing then this is not for you. This keyboard is for general usage and for general people. The price on which i got this keyboard is good. Can't expect much.I hope I answered your queries. :)"
3,"Product was delivered in good condition and on time. Packing was done good. However, the wire of the keyboard is very short. If you want something which requires access to a bigger area/table, this is not the one. Also, I'm facing an issue with the Ctrl + c command. IT should copy paste when we use this but instead I get print screen option. Out of ten times i used this command, I got the wrong print screen. Restarted my pc twice, toggled the the property in cmd as well, however, I'm not sure what is exactly wrong. I tried using a different keyboard and this issue never presented with that keyboard. So I either got a defective product or there is a command issue with this one.All in all, an okay product but I will never be buying this product ever again."
1,"After 1 day of use, many of the keys are hard / getting stuck (important keys - TAB, CTRL, BACKSPACE, ARROW KEYS, and some letters as well)I had purchased this product from Amazon earlier and it was fine. This time the quality is very poor. Unfortunately I opened it after 7 days so it is outside the return window.ZEBRONICS' 'warranty' is a joke - they expect you to commute 40 kms and spend 100 rupees to 'show' them a Rs. 400 which they 'will inspect' and possibly decline replacement!Last time I buy such cheap products. Better to spend double the amount and go with trustworthy brands that have sensible service."
2,"I bought this keyboard a few days ago. I find this keyboard very light, the good side is i like the special buttons for volume control, media player etc. The sad part is the keys are not very good or say very poor quality and some keys have already started to not work. I have press it hard to get the number or letter. The length of the usb cable is just 1mtr whereas other keyboards provide atleast 2 meters this really does make a difference in the long run.Overall i would say its only worth what you are paying it for. Okay for average use but for serious use not a good option."
5,"Don't go for high end brand when you have many benefits in this range. Keys are very easy to press. Lightweight ,compact design And have long cable to move easily and freely. Using for past few months. But as it is very light weight because of the body material so Use carefully.No gaming experience"
1,"I thought it will be a good cheap keyboard. It was cheap but not good. That's the problem it's just too cheap to be of any use. The keyboard is tok light to stay in place, the keys are very bad, typing experience is horrible. The keyboard is so flimsy that it flexes with a simple key press in the middle. Ultimately you get y what you pay for. Font buy this, you will struggle to use it. I couldn't even return the product, apparently I was only getting the option to replace it."
5,"Had received a faulty product. The keys were so soft that one touch would result in multiple entries of fame alphabet. Requested for replacement and got a new piece the next morning itself. The new keyboard is working fine now. Five star for product, 1 star for quality check procedure of the seller, five star to seller for quick response and replacement action"
1,"1. Layout of keys is absurd. Just to save an inch of space, the Delete, Home, End etc buttons are placed in a random order vertically.2. Keys are very sticky. Initially I thought the keyboard would smoothen after some use. But after three months the keys are even more tight and hard to press. In a typing flow, we miss many keys and have to retype them.3. The plastic quality is so poor that keyboard bends in the middle. Seems it can break any moment.4. Definitely not a gaming keyboard. Even I won't recommend anyone for typing purposes.Better to go for a slightly higher price keyboard. This one is really wastage of any money."
3,"This keyboard is very light weight with minimal material used for its making. The keys are soft, responsive and feels good for typing. A host of multimedia controls are available at the top which I must say this is the cheapest multimedia keyboard I brought to date. But if you are a person who type a lot then better pay extra & get yourself a high quality keyboard. This keyboard seems it won't last two months if you keep hitting hard on the keys. If you have a basic PC for which you need a keyboard for general use then its fine."
5,"I odrered this for my laptop. Came in a brand named cardboard box pacaking which we normally get when buying electronic items. But product is intact. Length of thr keyboard is 41 cm, breadth is 12.8cm and height is almost 2cm""(including key protrusion ).  Letters and symbols on the keys are coated well. I tried to scratch the letters on the keys with my nail and did not came off from the keys.ligh weight keyboard. Keys are soft touch too. Over all good product for normal usage"
1,"I've been using computer peripherals keyboards since the year 2000 and this is the worst one I had the misfortune to buy.It has been only a month and the keys gave up. Ctrl, Alt and Num lock keys stopped working altogether. Rest of the keys needs to be wrestled with a million times before giving any sound character outpit."
5,"Though got a damaged one and had 3 keys fallen to the right side of the keyboard in the package, I managed to put them back and keyboard worked perfectly, so kept it without asking for a replacement. Request the seller to be careful in future shipments.The keyboard worked perfectly and loving it, fit and finish, quality of plastic, cable and connector seems to be quite good for the price. My purpose for occasional use with laptop."
1,"This is the worst keyboard ever. It sells so cheaply for a reason - quality comes at a price. You're better off using a Windows on-screen keyboard, and click away at it with a mouse. You'd still be faster and more accurate than this keyboard.Pros: It's cheapCons: It's cheaply sold, cheaply made and performs cheaply. The key positions are different, which is understandable as it's not full sized keyboard. But the worst quality of all is the hardness of the key press. For a fast typer, it's so hard to press common keys like Enter, Backspace or Delete that your fingers start cramping up.You're better off burning your 200rs than buying this keyboard. It's the absolute worst"
1,"Do not buy this piece of garbage- very cheap quality- keys getting stuck within 1.5 months of use- shape of enter key is weird, different than normal- Not returnableI agree it is small and light but still cons outweigh these by landslide.Verdict: Don't Buy. Invest some more and have peace of mind."
3,"I needed a basic keyboard to replace my old logitech one. The zebronics multimedia keyboard is good value for money and comes with added hot key controls such as sleep, wake up, volume up/down and system shutdown.Will highly recommend to anyone looking for a cheap and basic alternative to the more expensive keyboards in the market.Edit 3-Dec-2020 - I am cutting down 2 stars because I have had issues with the keys not responding or they tend to type multiple times for just one keypress which is a headache. Unplugging the USB connector and connecting it back seems to fix the problem, but only temporarily"
5,"I recommend you to buy this keyboard. Because within Rs. 200 this keyboard works very good.On first order i bought damaged keyboard from seller, but Amazon immediately replaced it with new and perfect keyboard of zebronics.Key are soft. Dont waste extra money to buy others keyboard as this keyboard solve everything."
1,Don't take anybody this is the waste keyboard and mouse don't use this model please try another models
5,"Mouse is very comfortable and Size is really Big..(comparison pictures attached)Previously I was using Zebronics PRAXIS keyboard.. wanted to buy that, but was not available as it is discontinued by Company."
3,Nice and awsum product....
4,Product is good and very useful. Plastics also good quality. Mouse has trouble working on bright surface whether opaque or semi-opaque mouse pad. Had to buy a dark color mouse pad Rs. 40.Kids drop the mouse more 100 times from a height of 4 feet but every time it survives very nicely !!
5,"Very good product does its job, cost effective also."
5,Great product for value for money.Plastic quality can be improved for keyboard but mouse is pretty good.For daily use it can usable.
5,The keyboard and mouse is very good for your everyday use. I bought it because my laptop's keyboard was not working and it does the job very well.
5,beautiful & awesome
5,Got it as a back up to my wireless keyboard n mouse when system crashes. Coz it happened recently and wireless was useless till I got windows reinstalled at a vendor.Good finish and fell of plastic. Immediately connected which is nice.Using mouse for my laptop which is nice breather to the mouse pad.
5,"Normal, no negative impact... usefull for continues working"
5,"Excellent than expected üëç. Good quality.One thing like a suggestion is that, keyboard and Mouse wires are like very thin, consider a little thicker wire.Overall the product is superb."
5,i bought it for RS.299 in Great Indian Sale100% Value for money & still working properly
5,It is a good keyboard. Unlike other mouseit's mouse has a detailed touch. It responses very quickly.

5,Combo offer is best
5,Awesome product
5,All good but key are more near to each other but nice product
5,"No doubt, Its a 5 star product but it comes with its own set of minor issues which may affect certain set of users only.Rest its a wonderful product from Logitech. You get full functional keybaord in small comfortable to carry package with every required key on board. Typing is a breeze on this keybaord with soft responsive keys.UNBOXING1. Keyboard2. USB unifying receiver3. 2 AAA batteries pre installed (pull off white pullout from batteries, to power up keyboard)4. Two extra battery covers to choose your flavor (in all pink, blue, white)PROS:1. Full qwerty keyboard with numpad2. Keys are soft & responsive with proper feedback3. Full row of function keys with alternate shortcuts4. Light weight & overall small profile for easy carry on5. Comes with unifying receiver (look below for details)6. Nice looks, though not premium7. Good quality wrt soul porpose of keyboard ie typing8. Battery test: Working properly since 15th oct. Rest for how long it lasts, time will tell. Logitech claims 2 yr life, but i will update my review whenever battery replacement is required. Just for an idea, my mouse lasts for upto a year with single duracell, so we can expect good life from keyboard also.9. Upper arrow key is slightly projected, for easy identification in cramped layout of arrow keys. But you need to get used to it.10. Plug n play. Easy setup. Just connect & use.11. Works good with smartphone & smart tv also. Infact no setup required in case of android device, be it tv or mobile. Just plug in receiver & both keyboard & mouse will work without any issues.12. Price bracket. If you get to grab it on lightening deal, then its cherry on cake.CONS:1. Slightly thick profile especially in front zone, that too without a wrist rest, so may feel uncomfortable in long typing sessions.2. No caps, num, indicator, so you need to rely on software based on screen caps indicator. (in my case, my laptops own keyboard has caps led, so it indicates caps status)3. Would have preferred full size arrow keys. They could have reduced size of shifft key instead to accomodate. To cover all keys in small package, they have highly customized the layout. It will take time to get adjusted to it.4. Slight flex  in lower middle zone near space key due to improper height of mid zone rest pads. Theres 1-2 mm gap below them when keyboard rests on flat surface. So it can be fixed.5. Some basic fn shortcuts missing as per laptop perspective.-Theres this software named Setpoint by logitech available from product download page which you can use to customise FN + Function keys shortcuts. But you wont find setting to add brightness +/-, wifi toggle, touchpad toggle, projector etc. Its havving general shortcuts like my comp, copy paste, play pause, control panel, page up down etc.UNIFYING RECEIVER:It allows upto 6 compatible devices to connect to computer with just one receiver. Look for unifying symbol on device (orange square patch with clear asterisk mark) (pic attached)For easy setup,1. Install unifying software from logitech2. Start it and click on advanced3. Click on pair & follow on screen instructions4. All connected devices will be listed(Alternatively you can also follow direct steps on screen & click on next)Tested on Logitech B175 mouse & working properly. Both keyboard & mouse seamlessly connect to unifying receiver. B175 comes with normal reciever, but mouse is compatible with unifying technology.GENUINITY:Some users have commented on receiving fake or first copy product. I have received genuine product, successfully registered on Logitec site without any issue.Advice: Be carefull while choosing seller, to avvoid issues like this, check their ratings, amazon fulfilled tag etc. So far i had an awesome experience with Appario Retail.FINAL VERDICT:Its a perfect low cost, compact & effective device. You wont regret getting it. Its pros outweigh its cons. Havent faced any serious issue so far. Its all good & perfect company for may Dell XPS L502x."
4,"Its a nice keyboard and works great.PROS:1 light weight and compact2 unifying supported3 long lasting with batteries(24 months)CONS:1 has a bit flex when typing in center of the keyboard2 the stickers on keys are very reflective and not visible properly some time.3 has no indication leds for caps, num and locks4 up and down arrows are smallOverall a nice keyboard and would suggest if u can compromise few features for compactness and wireless."
1,"Do not buy this product. its fake.I got a duplicate item ,failed to register on logitech site.Logo  on the product differ from the original logitech logo even though the product in the picture given here has original logo ."
4,"i brought this keyboard for 650rs during a deal. and i still consider this as one of the best wireless keyboards under 1000rs but still it has some cons. now lets look at its  pros and coneslets starts with the pros‚óí it is one of the smallest full sized keyboard with a number pad, you can easily carry it around in your laptop bag‚óí i heard the battery life is awesome and it uses 2 regular AAA batterys which are cheaply available in the market‚óí it is from a trusted company and my previous experience with Logitech customer service is good‚óí you will get a slot to keep the dongle  in the keyboard itself and you will also get 3 interchangeable battery covers with the keyboard‚óí i didnt face any connection issues or lag while using the keyboardnow coming to the cons‚óì the frame of the keyboard is week and you may get irritated with it flex while typing especially with the stands on‚óì the navigation keys have an odd shape and its hard to use the up arrow properly‚óì overall the quality of the materials feels cheap and i don't think it can survive a drop or rough use, so you will have to use it carefully‚óì  if you intend to play games with it, just don't. then i will suggest to buy something wired or invest more to get something more rugged‚óì overall if you are looking for a wireless keyboard you can carry around in your bag you may go with this one. But as i said this is not intended for gaming or rough use if this review helped you please press that helpful buttonUpdate after 6 monthsEven after six months  of use the keyboard is working perfectly and i didnt have to change the batterys yet. That battery cover gets easly scratched though (images are included)"
1,worked fine only for a few days. post which either the shift key or the ctrl key would get stuck and cause issues with typing. Not at all expected from logitech
5,"Pros : Before i purchased it,  i used K220. This K230 is just an upgrade of the previous one. Very compact in size. We can use both Desktop and Laptop. We can hold it in our laptop bag during travelling. Those who are having the ability of speed typing, should purchase this product. Another one an important pros is they have made the SHIFT key as its original size. some immature keyboard manufacturer built the shift key as small size along with the nearest button of [ | \ ]. During speed typing, our finger may typed [ | \ ]button instead of shift key. But this key board built in correctly.  CONS: 1) There is no led light in Capslock key. 2) We need to hold FN button + printscreen, during capturing any screenshot instead of single print screen button."
1,"Initially the keyboard was good, now the keys are not functioning properly. I have to press really hard to make the keys work. It's not just one or two alphabets but most of the alphabets are having the same issue. This is not a durable product. I am forced to change my initial review."
4,"Logitech K230 is a wireless keyboard that comes with some interesting features. It is a compact keyboard which is  smaller as compared to the other keyboards. It is an affordable wireless keyboard and here, we take a look at its pros and cons:PROS.#.Good Wireless Connectivity.#.Security-128-bit AES Encryption#.Long Battery Life#.Travel Companion.#.Plug And Play.#.Value for money#Compact Design.CONS.#Some Fn Shortcut Keys Are Missing.Moreover it comes with 3 years warranty, which is quiet goods. Overall its good product to buy for daily use."
4,"Keyboard is compact, takes very little desk space and looks sleek.The keys are soft and its Great for typing.Ignore the reviews posted that it's not good for gaming. I've played warzone, fortnite etc. And faced no issues.Although while gaming it has key ghosting if more that 6-7 keys are pressed at the same time. Not an issue for most games your left hand has only 5 fingers.Latency: No issues, Modern wireless keyboards have come far as to face not such delayed response times. I can say the same for this keyboard as well.It'll take a few days to get used to."
1,I am not sure how this is rated so high yet a poor choice compared to other keyboards.1. The size of the keyboard is smaller than typically expected. You have to squeeze your hands to type and it is inconvenient.2. The keys on the lower row can easily come off in few months as it is not covered.It falls short on ergonomics and nowhere good for anyone who wants to type for a long time / with ease.3. The key tap is neither soft nor quiet.4. The product description image looks nice but it is a cheap plastic.4 You can replace but you cannot return this itemI wanted to replace my Dell keyboard for a better one but after buying this I started to like Dell keyboard better.
4,"It's not a deal maker or a deal breaker. It simply gets the work done, hands down. Numeric keypad is useful in such a compact size. Light weight makes it portable. You get two different coloured battery covers (on the left) as spare or to customize your needs.Logitech Unifying receiver is an added advantage as I am already using a Logitech wireless mouse. Just download the Logitech Unifying utility software and pair both devices to either of the receiver. Arrow keys are a bit small but I think you'll get accustomed to it. No Caps, Num, Scroll lights, but yeah there's FN key atleast. I think, you can't ask for much from Logitech at this price."
5,I liked below:Compact SizeNumber pad like normal keyboardSmooth and big buttonsUnifying receiver to connect 6 unifying wireless devices. (same unifying receiver of my keyboard paired with my old wireless logitech mouse without any hassle. Both the new kew board and the old wireless mouse working like a combo unit using single unifying receiver supplied with the unit)I did not like:There is no On/Off marking at the power switch at the back panel. I had to use external marker to note on/off of the unit.
3,"The keyboard got problems within a month of purchase - a few keys started working on their own, without pressing them, making the keyboard useless. Fortunately the Logitech Service Center in my city replaced it with a new one on the same day.Pros:1. Small & compact.2. Comes with a Unifying Receiver and Unifying support. So can be used with other Logitech Unifying supported devices with only a single receiver plugged in. I use my mouse (Logitech M235) such.3. Has a Numeric keypad.4. Logitech service is good as they provide replacement asap. And there's a 3 year warranty.Cons:1. No Caps lock on/off indicator. Same with Num lock.2. Flex in middle part of keyboard.3. Placement of certain keys is not good."
1,"Keyboard looks good, has swappable color cover for battery port (Silver, Blue and Pink).However, the biggest issue is that the keys are spaced too close to each other, arrow keys are horribly placed, numkey spacing is fine but keys like enter, backspace are too small. Result? Large number of mistakes when typing anything. Even the Function keys are immediately above number keys and you are bound to make wrong function calls due to this. Not even talking about lack of basics functions like lights to indicate caplock is on.Basically, its a keyboard that fails as a keyboard."
3,"Cursor key is one of the most used key for gaming/ documents and it is the most badly placed key in this keyboard .. it almost impossible to hit upper arrow with pressing any additional button with it. its kind of frustrating. and as amazon do not have return facility, Its useless product for me. I even trust to sell it as low as 500 but the next person returned it just after use of 30 minutes due to the same problem.  That much annoying design it has. Dont look as the cheapest price tag for logitech keyboard. It is one of the worst of logitech. I have 7 keyboard mouse of logitech and they all works fantabulous but this one Sucks."
1,I absolutely HATE it!I didn't return it right away as I waited to acclimatize to its HORRIBLE key placement - truth is even today after nearly 8 months of use I still have to look at the keyboard to hit the Delete & Backspace key.The reduced size is good to look at and also makes for a cute product shot but the buck stops there.
3,Does its job.For day to day typing and use its decent. Pros:Key travelKey feelPortableNo noticable input lagSturdy.Full numpad layout.Cons:Minimal key separation causing multiple keys to clickUnnatural key positioning diagonally across keys requiring adjustingSmall ctrl keyNot comfortable for gaming ( you shouldn't be buying this for that anyway)No special key LEDs ( caps/num)
5,"Very soft keys. And stylish look. Three color battery cover, on/off switch. N software for battery indicar and media keys function. Full size keyboard with number pad. And unifying technology was a master point. Because I have brought m235 mouse separately and joined with single dongle.  And I have registered both products in Logitech website so I get three years warranty. Thanks Amazon n seller."
4,"Product plastic is very average quality, not flimsy, but not strong. Key spacing is little congested, however after few days of use you can easily adjusted to it.  Up arrow key is little and placed little higher so we can easily recognize without seeing.Performance wise this keyboard is performing very nicely, range is good and no lag observed. Instantly connects when you plug the unifying receiver to it.I observed one issue in the product serial numbering which is also confirmed by Logitech. Box serial no is different and product serial no is different. As per Logitech, keyboard S/N no is important and that need to be registered at their website.Lets hope it last as it is expected. Will review again if any issue I encounter with this product."
2,"The size is very small. One can't type and do regular work on it.I never thought the keys will be this much small, that wont be able to type.Seeing the picture made the purchase and now its kept idle as can't be returned as well.Later on got different keyboard for using by visiting shop physically.Wont recommend the keyboard. Wastage of money only."
5,I have been using this wireless keyboard from past 20 days and I haven't switched it off even for an hour. I did it once just to check if it comes back. Good printing on keys. No hard pushing required. I do a lot of emails and codes so the more you type the more smoothly it gets.Never faced any disconnection or repeated key inputs. The supporting small hinges help typing faster if we lift it. And fast means real fast I am talking here. No delayed response from the transmittal. Light weight and compact but still got all keys covered. Only problem I see is no CAPS OR NUM but the system tells you if the caps ON so press once to off that's it. But at this price this is really good and gets the job done.
1,very difficult to type usin this that keys are difficulty to press as we are accompstomed to regular keyboard thse keyboard are too small and keys are place at irregular distane .even pressing shift keys are difficulty and those keys .dissapointed and htat space bar keep on pressing when i sleep and use this keyboard .dissaponited .why they made is so small .zebronics companion was better did a mistake ordering this any way had it been bigger would have given 5 star .need to order another good qualitythis i shall use while on the go traveling time any way if i practice in this keyboard i may l oose that typing skills in that regular keyboard .
4,I have been using this from beginning of Feb 2021. It is good but here few issues I would like to bring up:1. The letters and symbols on the key are protected by some coating they are such a strain to eyes and many a times I have to move your head to get the clear letter. For those used to typing without looking at key board it is fine but nor for others like me.2. I have already changed the battery once on 8th March 21. So it has come only for a month. The Logitech key board I was using for last 20 years (Bought in Dec 2001) had a very good battery life almost one year.But for the above it is very good.
1,"It's a pathetic keyboard. Coming from Logitech such substandard quality is a surprise to me! I ordered one and post receipt I realised that no matter how close or far you are from the PC, the keypad is unable to transmit properly thereby resulting in half of the things not being typed properly. Post pressing a particular key, its takes about 2-3 seconds for it to appear on the screen. And sometimes it doesn't even appear and to top it, the same letter appears continuously on the screen despite releasing the key.I returned the item and ordered a new unit. The new unit behaved well for a week or so and thereafter it too started giving the same problem. I think there is some fundamental problem with the design of the keyboard. I tried the keyboard on both my laptop as well as my PC but the problem persisted. Now with the return window closed, I am stuck with this defective item which works as per its own whims and fancies, typing and churning out letters on its own once a particular key is pressed.Overall a bad piece of equipment coming from a renowned brand such as Logitech.Bottom line: Don't buy it. It's a complete waste of money and is useless since it cannot be used even for basic typing without getting frustrated."
5,"Pros:This is the only reasonably priced keyboard I could find with Logitech unifying receiver, which could be useful for future mouse pairing with same receiver.The keys are reasonably quiet while being tactileVery compact form even with separate number pad.VFM at INR800Cons:There is no off switch. Need to check how long the battery lasts.The battery covers options doesn't include black (minor gripe)The piece I received had a very hard 's' key and I was about to return (replace) it. But with little bit of usage, it appears fine now. However this points to poor quality check by Logitech.Some may need time to get used to the placement of arrow keys, Home, End, Page up/down, but this is a necessary trade off for the compact size."
4,"This keyboard was perfect suit for my needs. I needed one that fits on my table and isn't stretched across the table. This kind of gives a feel of the 14"" laptop keypad. Its easy to type and occupies less space. Some of the pro's and con's after a month of use -Pro's:1. connects in a flash. the USB nano head comes with a small asterisk painted on top to indicate which side should be plugged into the PC. Does not fumble while plugging it in. Once plugged the connectivity is instant. Did not observe any lag in typing and keystrokes reflected on screen.2. Extremely compact. Got all the keys crammed in. Easy to type3. Convenient - easy to carry around and also occupies less space on the table topCon's:1. Certain utilitarian keys are missing. e.g. The right click key, backlight to indicate whether caps or num-lock is on2. the arrow keys usage needs some practice and skill3. Due to its compact nature some times your fingers might press the adjacent keys instead of the ones you want to hit. Takes a bit of practicing."
4,"Its a good wireless keyboard just plug and play so easy to use and its usefull for just daily tasks like typing and etc, its a bit small in size than other keyboards but for gaming its not ideal at all, if you want this gaming dont go for this i reckon coz the keys are on stiffer side and the key travel is deep so 'No' for gaming. Finally its good bank for buck for normal usage but definitely not for gaming. Thanks :)"
4,"Keyboard is compact. Key placement is also good. I bought this for daily office use. And my most of the work involves in writing code. So being compact, my fingers can reach the keys without much of wrist movement and gives me a confident feedback while typing. Connects like a gem and never had any issues so far. Been using it for last 2 months. The only downside I see is the function keys are slightly hard to hit. But nevertheless recommended keyboard! specially for programmers."
4,"Portable and good connectivity. Built quality is reasonable for this price. Good for browsing and general work. Not suitable for high speed typing.No CAPs lock LED. Bought along with mouse.Note: you have to install LOGITECH Unified software to work with keyboard along with mouse. If you bought only mouse, it can be used with out installing any software.The Battery backup is very good. You need not to turn off the switch.Another con is the keyboard turn On switch doesn't have marking. The upper side is ON. As there is no LEDs, difficult to find ON/OFF condition."
2,The BadVery compact and difficult to use as some of the keys are much smaller than they are on standard keyboards.Definitely can't be used by someone with even medium sized fingers.The GoodThere is zero lag between keystrokes and the screen.The keys are soft to touch with a good feel to them.Works with an existing Logitech universal receiver.OverallNot recommended...get the k400 series...way better and lasted 10 years before I bought this garbage.
4,Pros:1. This is a compact keyboard2. Looks nice and optional colours in side bar provide vibrancy3. Material quality is good4. Connectivity is seamless5.  Overall a solid feel of the product so looks durableCons:1. The top keys as well as the arrow keys are too small and thin to operate smoothly. This affects both speed and sometimes accuracy.2.  The board has keys spread all across right till the bottom to make it compact. This results in making it bit inconvenient to use the keys in the bottom line of the board.So consider Logitech K 345 or similar product for regular use and buy this one for occasional use (by kids/ others) only.
5,"I was a bit reluctant to buy a secondary HID for my Surface Pro 3, but when my type cover stopped working, I was left with no choice. I did a lot of research on Amazon and wanted an HID that was relatively inexpensive, but worked well with Windows 10. I decided to but this Logitech K230 keyboard, without knowing whether it will work properly. Sure, I went through all the Amazon reviews for this, but most of them were pretty useless, tbh!Well, the device arrived and I was pleasantly surprised at the build quality, look and feel of it. I simply inserted 2 AA batteries, plugged in the 2.4 Ghz wireless dongle in my USB hub and voila, I was up and running in no time.The keyboard is compact and lightweight, so very easy to carry around. The keys have a decent amount of travel and a pleasing clicking sound. The keys are also quite durable and I especially like the fact that there is a number pad as well.Overall, this is a very good device and highly recommend it as a portable HID."
5,"Logitech k230 wireless keyboard, obtained at rs 689, the price fluctuates but its always around rs 650 to 800.  As soon as I received the keyboard i unboxed it, the packaging is good at first the keyboard didn`t respond, turns out I didn't remove the directional paper attached over the battery terminal Works well with my laptop and android smartphone over USB otg.Pros :1. Works out of box, just connect the USB unifier to your laptop USB port.2. works in Linux too , just add the solaar package to get more functionality like pairing,wireles link and battery.3. works in android smartphone (I tested it in my oppo neo 7 and redmi 3s prime) both support usb otg.4. white color holder is really good.Cons :1. no place to keep usb unifier , so if I lose usb unifier I have to purchase  new usb unifier or the entire set.2. the wireless link breaks3. no manual and user warranty."
5,Got this awesome keyboard at at a price of ‚Çπ299. Keyboard has good grip at bottom. Smooth keys. Good height adjustable stand. Recommending all to buy this keyboard.
5,Good built. Smooth keys. Indian rupee key is made available. Good product in given price. I think it will long last. Though price is cheap but quality is better.
4,"Product is good, exactly as shown in the images. But the only thing I am surprised with is Amazon is now selling items without a GST bill. So, neither have i received any GST invoice with the product nor it is available to download from the order page. This is weird being the fact is that the GST invoice is the warranty card for this. Amazon must look into this matter.Uodate:- The GST invoice was available for download after two days of delivery."
1,I made the mistake of buying 2 Keyboards believing in Brand HP! Huge mistake.It is the most TERRIBLE Product.The Keys get stuck. Some keys behave erratically on its own.My money is wasted. But do yourself a favour. And stay away.
4,Review after usage of 1 week:1.Simple minimalistic keyboard2.Good for typing3.I use this keyboard for coding and development works.No complaints till now.4.Connects to and disconnects from laptop within second.Smooth and fast connectivity.
3,"Bought it on 24 Feb 2020, and the keyboard overall is nice with addition of just the volume control and no unnecessary buttons. However within 2 months i have a malfunctioning key - the letter 'b' is typed only sometimes. My usage is not much, still it has malfunctioned so early. Return period was within 7 or 10 days - no i'm stuck with it now. Will need to buy some other new one soon."
4,"The product is very good for the price range but there are a few minor quirks that I would like to point out for a specific kind of buyer.1.  The typeface printed on the keys are quite thin. If you are moving from using other keyboards with a more visible letters on the keys than you will have some time adjusting to the new keyboard, especially under low light condition.2. The body has mild flex in the mid section, although it is much better than the one you would find in Logitech K120.3. The keys are quite soft and silent, easy on the fingers, but lacks that tactile feedback you would normally find in other keyboards from bran such as Lenovo."
5,"There's nothing to take away from this guy. I am using it with macos and the scroll lock, pause, home keys are automatically used for some mac shortcuts. F11 takes you to desktop. And the dedicated sound buttons are just life savers. The build at places is a little too glossy for me, but overall it's been an absolutely perfect purchase.P.S. Typing noob so can't compare with typing experience. Gaming noob so... You get it! Just an average keyer who liked what he got!"
5,"The typing experience is very nice. The tactile feedback is very good. At this price, This is an excellent choice and the keyboard has volume up/down and mute controls which is very convenient."
4,"If anyone thinks that it is the same keyboard as one gets with the HP PCs or AIOs then you are wrong. I typing this review with the above keyboard itself. The keys are nice and travel is as usual. But, when one compares with the keyboards provided with the HP PCs and AIOs, then it is not that sturdy and heavy. The keys are very soft and free as it is a new one and i am pretty sure it is not a heavy duty one. It is not heavy and strong. OK product. The quality wise it is giving me the same feeling which i have with frontech or intex cheap keyboard. For office uses it is a sure NO and for home [WFH] purpose it is ok. Will update more as the time goes with it using."
1,Some keys are inoperative. Didn't expect this from hp brand. Very disappointed! There's no option for return. Only replacement.. have requested for replacement. Will update the review after receiving the new keyboard.
4,"What's important for keyboard is to make a consistent key layout. Many manufacturers these days ignore such fundamental design principles, and this keyboard is no exception. I chose this keyboard for avoiding a specific odd placement of inverted 'Enter' key. This keyboard has a straightforward Enter key, but oh boy. The PrintScr/Scroll Lock/Pause-Break buttons are lifted off from their original row of function keys, down one step. This is done to accommodate a ridiculous set of volume control buttons which rarely anyone uses. This further pushed the Insert/Home/Page Up keys one row down.Now, I need to get adjusted to this new odd behavior. Every now and then I screenshot my desktop, when I've to 'Insert' something. Nothing happens when I think I'm banging on Page Up (but Pause/Break is at that position).Do these multimedia gimmicks on maybe so called flashy multimedia keyboards please, spare the professional versions."
2,Better look for any other alternative brand since HP is neither offering options such as entry level priced keyboard and premium one nor willing to improve despite of many people giving feedback about hard keys.  Such arrogance is not permitted in today's time when there is no dearth of options.  NOT RECOMMENDED.
5,"I choose this keyboard and it was perfect for what I needed... Typing feels good and crisp, product quality is decent as well...It works great..highly recommended..*I don't play games on this keyboard,so I don't know if it would be good for gaming or not.."
3,"Cheap price and quality. This was only branded cheaper option for wired keyboards. Works perfectly fine. Keys dont get stuck while typing.Quality of plastic is average and the keyboard raiser at the back are extremely flimsy. One broke after 3 months.Most of the other wireless keyboards are way costlier than this, so this gets the job done."
2,I bought this in Feb of 2021 and it worked erfectly (key not working) for a month or so and then started showing wear and tear. Many keys on the keyboard don't work anymore. This is the kind of roducts we are getting nowadays. They hardly last a few months.
1,Purchased in June 2020 and and the space bar is not working (first week of Sep). Did not last even 3 months.  Tried to fix the membrane by opening the key. Did not help. VERY POOR QUALITY. HP website does not even recognize the product (tried with Product number and Serial number)
5,"I was so tired while searching for keyboard for my 17‚Äùlaptop,  finally I went with simple thought to try this keyboard and surprisingly it is compact and well suited for my laptop.And I highly recommend as it is simple and cost effective."
5,"I ordered this for work from home, this is similar to the keyboard that I used at office. Works as expected, characters are clearly visible and decent click action. It has no back light and not recommended for gaming. Overall  it is worthy for work from home."
1,"Very bad..hardly used to for two weeks and almost all the keys have become hard.  I want to return but return period is over . I would definitely suggest people not to buy this. Waste of money. Was using Logitech for 4 years, no issues.  This keyboard lasted hardly two weeks.. a big no if you ask me."
5,"I needed a keyboard for the purpose of typing so I picked this keyboard. The design and quality is delectable. It has got volume keys. Feels strong and sturdy, smooth to type. My papa made a blue cloth cover for the keyboard to avoid the dust issue."

3,"Bought it for my work desk setup.PROS:-The keyboard looks premium and build feels good.-Keys are soft to touch and the response is quick as well.-The key travel is also good.CONS:-The edges of the keys are too sharp and was a bit comfortable while we land our fingers on the edges.-For a mac user, the keys felt small, so we tend to press on wrong keysIf you are comfortable with keys being a bit small and want to have mechanical keyboard type feel with less or no noice then you can consider buying this."
1,.....this away in a week as I spilt some beer on this by accident. I shook off all the moisture and dried it for hours in the sun for four or five days before discarding it. Buy spill- proof keyboards.
5,"After using many keyboards over the years, I found this most comfortable and best ergonomic keyboard. It is joy to type on this key board for long hours and long time. Good for programmers as well as those people who type all the times !"
3,The keys are very clunky so not useful for gaming at all or even fast typing. Build quality is okay. Good enough for normal users.
5,"The product is very light in weight. All keys are very smooth and makes typing easy.I am using it in both my desktop computer and laptop computer. When I received this keyboard I was surprised to see it's good material and nice looking.The keyboard has three hot keys and usb pin for connecting to pc.hot keys are volume up, volume down and mute volume. Keyboard also works with otg supported Android phone.I have tested it with yureka plus(Android 10)."
4,Yup Value for money good. Writing this review after 2 months of purchase .Some times i feel the keys are a but far like the H key is a bit hard to reach and i type g a lot not sure if my problem or the keyboards.. But overal the keyboards syill fine and kicking  .Go for it .
5,Brought this product and have been using it for a month now. Very happy with it. The keys and the ergonomics and the usability is really good and worth the money. The delivery was also super quick. I would say that this keyboard is perfectly suited for hard and soft typers alike. The wire length is also good and overall I am really happy with the product.
4,I bought this for INR 616 since my old keyboard had stopped working. I am satisfied with it and seems to be ok. All keys are working and the keyboard has decent ergonomics
5,"This is very easy to type and properly spaces keyboard with good response from keys. Great to type on, great for office use. Good for gaming too"
4,"Its a plastic so it's very light but the longevity is something that can be... low, for me, so far, it's been good.Yes it is mechanical keyboard, but don't expect the clicky noise to be what you want, it's plastic body so... it sounds okay.For it's price range, it's really good. Even though it's Plastic, it doesn't feel like it will break very soon.Its an okay product.Gaming-  sorry I don't game on pc so I don't know..."
1,"Updated Review: Horrible purchase.You can't clean the keyboard easilyThe keys flick out while typingBattery life is super awful for both mouse and keyboardBought 3 sets, all 3 same issue. It isn't cheap because the experience and aftercosts are awfully excessive. Regret it with utmost frustration.Old review below isn't valid anymore but leaving it so you can see what really happened and how awful this set is.Old Review„ÄãOver the decades I have purchased many Wireless Keyboard-Mice set including big brand names like Logitech, Microsoft and Dell. While they are good quality but are often too expensive for most buyers or the lower range sets do not have the quality required. This keyboard and mice set by Zebronics is finally the answer to both the problems.Pros:1. Sturdy make and elevated keys are really super convenient to use.2. Very easy to clean and maintain without much hassle3. Battery lasts really long and best point - single battery each for both keyboard and mouse.4. Mouse is just the right size, neither too bulky, nor too small.5. Low Battery indication is super handy in the keyboard.Cons:1. Mouse does not have low battery indication but then again with only one battery requirement, its not a big one2. No Indicators for Num, Scroll, and Caps-Lock keys being active.If you look at the entire package, and pricing, it is great value for money. I was skeptical at first but after buying one set and seeing its performance over 6 months, I purchased yet another set and intend to replace all sets one by one with the Zebronics Companion 102 model specifically.My recommendation - GO FOR IT!"
5,"Have been looking a good range wireless keyboard for a very long time and now i can lit up my head that i have got a perfect wireless keyboard and mouse. I strongly recommed it to the office users as most of my presentation i bring up laptop and all the time i have to walk near the laptop to change the slides, now why worrie? when i got this wireless keyboard to change the slide from the place where is stand. I also use it for my personal home use where i can sit in the couch and watch my fav movie from lap and no need go near to the lap to change the movie just sit on my couch and use my fav keyboard...Zebronicz is always the best in the market and this item is far good.. I blindly recommend it.. I give my personal guarenntteee.."
3,"I ordered this combo pack and was promptly delivered the next day. Thanks Amazon for the experience.The keyboard required 1*AAA battery and the mouse needs 1*AA battery which fortunately comes along with the package. The keyboard has floating key design which has good tactile feel to it and so far has been crisp. However the same cannot be said for the mouse as it feels small in the palm and has very inaccurate pointing.Overall, when compared the price with other big brands this package it an essential VFM product.Edit: Reducing a star because of the poor performance of the mouse, it lacks precision and battery life awful"
1,"Cheee worst, this keyboard already stopped working and thanks to amazon for selling worst products at cheap price without maintaining any standard. No customer service from zeb as well wasted all my money"
5,"Guys this product is too good üëå in its range ... I bought it in 9‚Ç¨ price might be fluctuate as per demand ... Lets come on its review keyboard buttons are amazing , sensitive enough , design is well and good  , connectivity is at its best . Mouse design is ok , connectivity is super awesome ... I would recommend u guys to go for it üòÅ I am totally satisfied with it .... Go for it üëç"
5,This combo of keyboard and mouse is very useful for daily activities on laptop l. The precision is good and the in built design is good.The only issue is sometimes the keyboard is malfunctioning sometimes and goes on typing the same letter for so many times.
5,Bhare!!Jordaar..
1,Disappointed by the product I received. This is the 2nd time I've ordered this product and I'm having the same issue. In previous order also the mouse was damaged and now in this order also the mouse is damaged.
5,By far very good if anyone wants a budgeted keyboard and a mouse go for it.Just an issue the light in keyboard if at night or dark room you use not so effective bus looks great will suggest to buy it.
5,Mouse battery consumption is too high
5,"very user friendly , light weight, responsive keysthanks"
5,As a gamer i always love to use a wireless keys and mouse but not all are worthy until.i find this awesome keyboard trust me one of the best in Market and makes a best in Amazon store. Now i can take my place in my room and connect wirelessly and play my game anytime anyplace best for our generation ppl
5,"Everything is fine, except the absence of light indicator for. Caplock key. Battery for Mouse drain fast."
4,"This wireless keyboard is very good as expected. But with regards to the mouse, the build quality and the look should have been better. And both keyboard and mouse works really good. Good part is that have got batteries(Normal one, not a rechargeable) along with the packing that I received so no need of buying it again."
5,Vert nice and sleek product
5,It's a good keyboard & mousebattery life is longworks perfectly finedesign is new & nice
5,Pretty good. Soomth for typing and comfortable to set. Easy installation. Auto sleep mode great feature in this. That feature seems great.
5,Keyboard and mouse are of very good quality. The range is also very good as i m using it for my cctv. Works fine. Looks good. Amazing quality.
5,Very good product at reasonable price. Handy to use
4,"For a office purpose it's great good product , if u are searching for a basic wireless keyboard and mouse u can go for it"
5,if you don't give the battery it i okayBut low quality battery are loss u r reputation
5,Good product üëçüòπ
5,"Just enjoying the feel it, looks good on my table clutter free, i have been using it for a couple of month not on a regular basis and the battery is still running for me.The only concern for me is the keys of my keyboard as it is an island type and some time it gets stuck on cloths and other stuffs my only fear is ""I might loose it some day""."
5,"Recently I have purchased this product. One of the awesome part of this product is a single adapter can be used for connecting both the keyboard and mouse. I have using the keyboard and mouse for both coding and gaming purpose, it works good for me. And best of all is that it's price of 750rupees."
5,Always zeb good brand. It proves with this.
1,"I have used this product for 3 months and now I am suggesting you people not to buy this keyboard and mouse. Battery life is very less and build quality is also low. Please dont go with its cheap price. My mouse is not working properly. Sometimes it work. Sometimes doesnt. The light in its mouse is not optical means not invisible. For wireless mouse optical invisible light is must for more battery life. My keyboard is completly filled of dust which I cant clean. Finally I need to tell, please dont buy this."
5,This product has nano technology which is good and both keyboard and mouse need only one sensor
5,I am using this product from last 5 month.It's working good.Battery life also ok for my light use.Little issue in Keywords key it's remove easily.
4,Not comfortable to use as key rows are arranged on same plane.
5,As of now its working good but battery included with this worst. My battery stopped working in mouse.
5,Supr quality
5,Battery draining very soon
5,"It is working very good, lightweight, everything is good about it."
5,Very good product
5,awesome product for the price. auto connect in windows 10. no drivers needed. very fast.
5,Value for money
5,keyboard keys are going to smoothly
5,Good product
5,Good product
5,It is very nice product light weight and good for gaming
5,The design of the keyboard is very stylish. It has soft keys for smooth and effortless typing. The small shortcut keys beside the keyboard makes it a complete keyboard in a budget range.
1,"this was my first and last amkette product.. very very poor quality. many keys stopped working after 10-15 days, now it is completely useless for me. and customer support is also very bad."
3,"Hardcore gamer here, the W key started fading after 2 months of use.2-3 big sized key(Num + and Tab) needs pressure for output.On the positive side, The design is good and stylish and weight properly distributed.Once it becomes adjusted you can type really fast if that's only your priority go for it."
5,"It is a very good keyboard in the ‚Çπ350-range. Keys are moderately soft, and is comfortable & quiet for normal typing. The multimedia keys are all working properly. Not much rugged design (but not that loose either) , but of course, in this price range, you can't expect much, but you are getting a decent one ! Also, packaging was decent. MUST BUY FOR NORMAL TO MODERATE USAGE. ALTHOUGH FOR HIGH INTENSIVE GAMING, THIS MAY NOT SUFFICE."
4,"It's been around 10 days now that I am using this keyboard. It's kinda okay for it's price, nothing great nor anything bad. Though it could have been better. The plastic that is used here feels kinda cheap and hard hitters can type twice the same letters that they are tryna type. Feels extremely light in weight so it doesn't give you a sense of great quality in this keyboard. Though design wise it looks good atleast from a distance. Keys are extra smooth so they don't feel forced on this keyboard which is a good thing but can be bad too if you are typing rapidly because you would end up typing the letter twice and then you would have to go back and delete it. Though it's a fair attempt to provide a fancy looking keyboard at this price, so it's alright not a bad keyboard. It serves the purpose and that's enough."
1,"The look attracted me ..So I took a chance and went a head to get this product.. but was disappointed with the build quality of the product, plastic is very delicate and can be easily broken... I'm not sure if it's leak proof as I take care of it very much also gaming i haven't tried ... So only build quality is the concerned point here.. Typing is really soft"
1,"I owned it for a while, never had much use till lockdown and wfh.. This is a very bad keyboard for working.. Has to edit each line to remove repeated letters after typing. There is a 10 percentage probably that one key press types it twice.. that means every line in an email will have 3 repeated letters.. So painful..  Also it's a flat keyboard. Nothing special in ergonomics regard."
4,"I ordered this keyboard as my long running logitech keyboard gave up. I have never been fan of Amkette products considering their cheap quality.However I was pleasantly surprised with this product. The keyboard has got separate multimedia buttons on the right side and quick access keys on the left. The WASD keys and arrow keys are marked in orange which gives it a gaming keyboard look. The keys are very soft to type and are precise to strokes.Overall a value for money product with good ergonomics, fast typing and casual gaming."
1,"I am not a gamer. I needed a Keyboard for software development, I bought this on 21st May 2020. Reviewig o : 07th July 2020.Pros:The keys are butter smooth. I liked it very much.Cons:10 days ago, the PageUp button stopped working.Now B and N keys are not working. Either I eed to press hard or it will get typed with multiple characters.So, If you wat a reliale keyboard. Thik wisely and get a etter oe.Puzzle: Add N or B in the unrecognizable words in this post. I typed this sentence from my laptop, hence it is readable. The rest are typed using the this Keyboard.While writig this review,  the Left Arrow key stopped fuctioig."
5,The keyboard is quiet sturdy at this low cost for just Rs279. Been using it for 6+ months and its still going great. Its keys are not hard nor too soft. No ghosting at all. Keyboard multi function button on both sides edge (orange) are working exactly shown.  its a full fledge keyboard in compact size.  Its just plug and play no cd or installation needed.Con I would say has a usb wire which is a bit short than normal keyboards if its for desktop.Honestly i was sceptical about this keyboard at that price but I went ahead and purchased it and now I am HAPPY that I made the right choice. You can go ahead too if you dont want to spend more for HP or dell keyboard which has less functions and those all the things which this keyboard does .
2,So I ordered this product under a lightning deal but due to my bad luck some keys were not working in the keyboardI asked amazon for a replacement and they replaced the keyboardAgain some weren‚Äôt workingI took refund of the keyboardStory endsNow from my experience you should definitely not invest in this cheap productYou can go for amazon choice keyboard or any other branded keyboard like HP or Dell
2,my experience was bad with this keyboard.Received the keyboard first time stopped working in few days.Then request for replacement second time got broken keyboard hence i returned the second time and finally got a refund.Mainly the keyboard size is short too.Go for Logitech or dell by paying extra 200 rs which actually worth
5,"Product is good, After recieving the product I felt it's little bit small.But the keys are smooth.Length is 18.5 inchBreadth is 6.5 inchUnwanted extension given below the space bar. Key texture and print are good.Cable quality is also above average.The media and special keys at the sides are super. At first they didn't work but after restart they are working fine for windows 10 OS. It has around 13 holes to remove dust dust and liquid spills from bottom. It has 17 screws to open the back cover.Completely plastic body"
1,Dont buy this keyboard ...its filmsy plastic ....keys are going to break in weeks ... my previous keyboard was iball ..it worked up to 6 years...  I have a amketee wirless keyboard which keys are fine ... ( security issue is there in wirless keyboards)  so i try to purchase this amkette keyboard ... I will buy iball keyboard from shop ...I lost my money anyway
5,"Writing this review almost after a months of use.I must say it is a good purchase for me. In this price range this is a very good product. Not very much sturdy, but enough rigid as per price. Does not have premium look. Typing is good. Not issues with typing. I also tried gaming with this keyboard. I played pubg with it. It does not have sticky key issue. More than 3 key roll over is possible. But it feels that the key are harder in terms of gaming. You should not expect it as a gaming keyboard cause it's at least 1/10th of price compared to proper gaming keyboard. So I'll rate it a five star considering it's price."
5,"The buttons are very smooth and soft to touch and the multimedia buttons eases up our work.Only drawback i saw till now is that maybe the buttons are not very mch durable for a long use i guess.It's been 4 months i'm using this and didn't noticed any problem bt the keys durability.Some mostly used common keys FOR e.g :- M key for opening MAPS in games gives little different feel when pressed.So, ive removed the button and adjusted the material inside button to the centre and placed the key back in hoping to regain that old smoothness and surprisingly it got smooth again.That's it ....other than this key thing, which is also not a big deal and on the basis of that you can't judge this keyboard.In this price Range this Keyboard works like a CHARM****"
2,"I bought this keyboard for ergonomics, primarily, the functional and easy to reach multimedia buttons on the right and the left..I am a designer and I listen to music 90% of the time that I am working on my computer. The volume up and down, forward, backward, pause/play buttons on the right and the mute, calc, folder, home and email buttons on the left are extremely useful to me and very easy and quick to reach and use.The material and build quality of the keyboard however sucks. I think it's been a month since I bought it and several keys started popping out and falling off within a couple of weeks. I have to push them back in place every now and then. I am not sure but I think there have been a couple of instances of double key strikes/mis-trikes etc. I don't think this keyboard is gonna last very long.The design is beautiful however and I wonder from whom Amkette rippled it off...oh okay ..they ripped it off from Foxin, coz I have owned an identical keyboard from Foxin which was cheaper and better built though not excellent ..Foxin might have ripped the design off from some other brand as well ..who knows ..or they both purchase from cheap third parties ... I've attached pics of the Amkette and the Foxin side by side for reference...."
5,The keyboard is just awesome. The keys are smooth and doesn't make any noise. While gaming also it feels nice. Most keyboards at this price range starts getting stiff keys and all but even after rough and rash use its still smooth and noise free. The only demerit is the keys cannot be removed or cannot be interchanged. Apart from that everything is super.
3,"When I got the product, the escape key wasn't working, after some this it did work, but still stops in between. I wouldn't recommend the product if you are going to use it for typing since the enter key is weirdly shaped and I not reachable when you are touch typing.The only thing I liked about the product was the color. Overall I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,"This key board is very good in a reasonable rate. Also it has media player controlling option and all most silent keyboard.It can  be improved more by placing some very small white LED bulbs along the four corners , two at tops and one near up/ down arrow sign, inbuilt.Then it could be operated in dark room , when students studying but his/ her parents are sleeping in same room, so it could have been a newest type of key board in the market."
1,"This was my first Amkette product and I was in a desperate need of a keyboard given the WFH scenario. I usually read a lot of reviews before going in for a purchase and to be honest I did do a bit a research on this purchase as well. However, given the urgency, I probably cut a few corners in my product research. And I am suffering the consequences of it.Coming to the problem at hand, the first key to give up was the Shift. Then, after a few days 9,6 and 3 on the numpad gave up. I am at a point now wherein I get gifts in the form of a new key giving up every day.Can you imagine the horror, for someone who works in the IT industry, of not having a properly functioning keyboard. I am throwing this one out the day my new keyboard arrives."
3,"Specifically bought this one for gaming as dont want to ruin my laptop keyboard.The keyboard is decent in terms of build quality. Ive played COD,CS,FARCRY titles without any issues.The only problem i feel is, you have to press the keys hard while typing unlike other branded keyboards like dell,hp etc.The shorcut keys for volume, previous,next etc really help while watching videos. However plz be careful as they get accidentally pressed while you lift the keyboard for some reason while gaming or watching a video."
5,Really satisfied with the keyboard. It's best in the market. Way better than zebronics multimedia keyboard. Multimedia keys are very helpful and are placed better. Keys are soft and keyboard is strong. Everything seems good. Note:- And i'm never buying zebronics keyboard again. Stopped working in just one week and service is very bad.
5,"If you're looking for a good trustworthy keyboard at this price range, look no further. You can easily go with this option.Have been using this for around 3 months now and it's serving its purpose just fine. Plus the ergonomics are really good and the multimedia keys are a blessing. The multimedia keys are one the main reasons I bought this.However, if you're looking for hard-core gaming, I don't think this product is for the long haul. You'll be able to play comfortably but for me and some other users as well, one or two keys might get stuck at times; has already started happening with me with the Shift key so this is one of its disadvantages. Not an absolute deal breaker though cause you can't expect more than this at this price range.It feels like a premium product and I remember this company Amkette making floppy disks during my childhood so yeah another good point.A definite buy at this price range!"
4,"Writing this review 2 years after the purchase..Pros:Seems to work fine even after a period of 2 years. No problem with key functionality and super smooth as well as silent. Compact design . A big advantage, it has a separate key for controlling sound/music etc. More than worth the priceConsNote that I've been using the product for 2yearsKeyboard is not for hardcore gaming or games which includes multi keys to be pressed at the same time. Ghost key count is less. The print seems to fade if same keys have been used continuously..refer pics uploaded."
5,"I am basically practising Touch Typing for a long but this keyboard helped me score the top speed easily.The first Impression>>>Pros:>Keys are really soft and spacing between keys are low because of that it is easy to reach on every key easily.>Utility Keys on both sides of the keyboard is so helpful and accurate.>Light Weight (May be due to  plastic build but I didn't feel that as low quality)>Height of the keyboard is less (compared to previous keyboards I had used) because of that it is easy to reach numbers and function keys(F1, F2....).> SilentCons:> Utility keys on both sides are of Rubber finish and sometimes it feels little stiff(just a little). But it doesn't matter much because the response is really so accurate and fast.> Size of ""Enter"" key seems a little bit small compared to other keyboards because of that my pinky fingers need to be stretched a little more while touch typing.Overall worthy for this price range."
4,"This is the best keyboard for typing. Even though the materials look cheap and feel cheap its really comfortable for those people who type alot in the computer. I dont recommend this for hardcore gaming coz at sometimes the keyboard just stops working for a few seconds. If you are playing some causal games then its good. And again for typers this is the best keyboard, once you get used to it you can type really well."
5,"Do not expect a very high quality keyboard at this price. However if you just looking for office purpose, mails , multimedia use. Its a very good option since it does have extra keys for multimedia too. Looks a bit flimsy but hey the price is cheap..comes with warranty of 1 year. For gamers I will say go with something more robust and strong.if you can buy a gaming laptop or desktop then definitely you can save more to get a high level keyboard too."
3,"I ordered this keyboard back in june 2019. Within a year my numerical keys above the alphabet keys stopped working. And recently the shift keys and some of the other special character keys have also stopped working. For the price it is worth it if you are in a pinch and need a new keyboard, like I did. But I would recommend against getting it as a gaming keyboard or hoping that with will last for years."
4,"I wanted it for my laptop as working on keyboard is easy. Coming to quality, it feels flimsy, key strokes do not bring confidence of a good quality product, feels like they may come out in few months usage. This is definitely not made for heavy keyboard users (those writing long reports or work extensively on Excel sheets). The shortcut keys for volume, calculator, hard drive, email client, desktop, etc are very handy and useful"
5,"Liked the shortcut true the most.Opening the mail, calculator,browser, file manager has become very easy with it.Along with this the media playback controls are also awesome.Typing experience is very satisfying with noiseless keys .Keyboard has many holes at the backside that helps to drain water if some thing spills on it without damaging the keyboard.The rubber padding on the lower end of the keyboard isn't sufficient. Due to which it slightly slips on the table while typing. Although it is a good product"
3,"Overall good and functional but build quality is flimsy. The image is a bit misleading in terms of build quality. Not gamed yet, but all keys are working. Note that the ‚Çπ key will work with English India pack only. Its pretty good if you tend to work or play in total darkness but don't have the budget for a good quality backlit board. The plastic used is so cheap and feeble that even normal typing bends the board."
5,"For a price of Rs. 400, Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard is truly good to use. Keys feel comfortable to hit or to push down upon softly. I have no hesitation in recommending it. Recently, a new version of it having UV coating and splash proof design has been launched under the label Amkette Xcite Neo Wired USB Keyboard. It looks more sober and elegantly laid out now!"
4,"I have bought this for ‚Çπ300 when I wanted a super cheap keyboard for gaming on laptop.I used this everyday for 1 year 10 months until very recently when the cable at the keyboard joint broke and became unusable.It is very lightweight and ergonomic. It is often advertised as water-proof which I have tested but then again how often do you swim with a keyboard üòÇ. Keyboard still looks good despite such heavy gaming use and the added buttons on its sides were very useful. For gaming particularly, I didn't see any added advantage nor was I expecting any either. I just needed a cheap keyboard for gaming so that my laptop keyboard did not wear out early because of gaming.I am slightly disappointed now it has become non-functional but it was very cheap and I had zero long term expectations."
1,"If you really want low budget Keyboard please go for zebronics or quantum.. I would recommend Logitech or TVS if you dont have budget idea. As I have a PS/2 Logitech keyboard for 13 years till now working well.For budget dont go for Amkette...I bought it for 275 thinking i saved money a lot. But It stopped working after 1.5 year but i  used that very very rarely..Most of the time it was unplugged and idle and untouched..So i cannot claim warranty .So i opened the keyboard and i was shocked there is only a tiny low quality toy microcontroller chip which will easily stop working if we drop the toy..Just like that of you drop the keyboard , there is high chance that it will stop work .I have dropped the logitech literally so many times but still it is working good. The quality is so so poor that the real manufacturing value of the amkette keyboard will not exceed hundred ruppess... The chip , soldering is so low quality .and low standard... Dont buy this keyborad if it is beyond 250rs.. And dont buy this if you have chances of dropping it.. The usb voltage fluctuation if occurred might also affect the chip very easily.. Go for branded please... Now the useless keyborad is used as a toy for kids to teach alphabets and learning keyboard without computer.. Thanks.."
5,"Lets just rate the entire procedure.(Based on 3 day experience)1.Delivery-Like always ..way before the stipulated date.10/102.Packing - Excellent. On addition to the Carton coverage the keyboard was wrapped in bubble wraps. So 10/103. Product- Sleepy, Ergonomic, & perfect for any purpose. The product was exactly as per the specifications. Little bulky but still manageable. The 10 shortcut key on the sides are a blessing! It fits perfectly for my work needs with volume,track controls, Calculator, MailSo if you managed to read all this , I would say go for it before it runs outEdited (01-02-2021)Never expected to be writing this, but the item has stopped functioning. Literally Nada. Nothing works. Except for the occasional luck-based one timer when it works. Otherwise just an unproductive expense. Infact this worked only for like 3-4 weeks , enough time to relieve Amazon for refund or exchange liablities. So I guess the rating for me then comes down to a mere 3 /10"
1,"Its a Total wastage of money and time. Pls DONT BUY this kryboard. Instead buy 300 rs standard keyboard that is far far better than this costlier. If you are looking for typing practice through this keybord then reconsider your idea. I have to return it within w days and i bought Dell branded keyboard that costed me bit more 650 but that is value for money item. Dont waste you time for this type of keyboard. Capslock, numslock, scroll locks mallfunctioning; when you type in speed the many keys characters are repeated and many  are skipped. Its difficult to install this keyboad with laptop. It doesnt install many times. Overall amkette spoiled my time. Wont ever recommend any of their product."
5,"all good , all keys work proper;y expect 3 keys1st shift+2="" ( whenever in keyboard wrote that when you press shift +2 =@) this problem is solve by exchange that both keys but their is not hastage keywhen i press shift + 3 =¬£ this icon comes that was not good for my work and their is not any key which can replaced by '¬£' key.  all are very good infect write this comment with this keyboard .  i use this from 2 or 3 days and this very good. check keys 1st when you recive this thanks for your time .if anyone want to grow their instagram accounty ,youtube channel then contect me  on my IG ID @moonlight_promotions"
5,"This keyboard is good quality and looks reliable as i have been using it without any issue for the past year. But the paint on repetitively used keys may come off after 1 year of use.But in spite of the paint issue, i have ordered the same keyboard again for another computer. I like the smoothness of this and reliability."
3,"delivery before time but packaging was poor.in fact open.so i checked all the keys in itPro:1.multimedia keys2.spill water proof3.gamng look3.lightweightcons:1.plastic quality in little on downside,cheap type. no arms or lap rest proper space2.shut down button should also be included like multimedia keys.i have this feature in my previous foxin keyboard fkm 902."
1,This keyboard+mouse combo has not lasted even for a month. Mouse has lost its sensitivity and the scroll has become completely unpredictable. Keyboard is also poor but the mouse undoubtedly leads the competition.Keyboard has the unique ability to type a character multiple times while the key is pressed only once. So entering a password at any website is the most challenging task.I am fed up with this typing adventure so I just plugged my old keyboard & mouse back to the PC to share this critic.Please use your money wisely and buy some longer lasting & reliable product.
1,The keyboard is very hard and the keys don't work if you are used to pressing them the normal way. The only way to use the keyboard is if you can hit the keys hard like old type writers. Very uncomfortable and almost useless.The mouse is of very cheap quality. The scroll button the middle doesn't work half the time and sometimes scrolls in opposite direction. Mouse buttons are very hard too.

5,I have using this keyboard and mouse combo since past 24 hours. And trust me you cannot get a combo better then this in less then 500. The build quality of mouse is very decent however the build of keyboard can be better. However it does the job and do it really well. If you are looking for anything in budget this combo is a go to. Feedback is very good however the keyboard is bit noisy. It not a proper chicklet but spacing of keys is bet good and hand will set on this in no time.Highly recommend.
1,"This product is a really really mess.ON MY ORDER: I received the keyboard and mouse that had too much lagg as well as words are getting typed multiple times.ON MY REPLACEMENT: I received the keyboard that had letter ""R"" pressed into the keyboard and that too in 90 degree angle to other keys. Just imagine. The standard of this product.I m really clueless, just so poor quality. Yes, it costs very less comparing to other products, but that doesnt means to give unusuable product to a customer."
2,"Both the keyboard and the mouse are very painful to use!The keys on the keyboard are very hard and cause pain in your hand/fingers! It took me some time to realize it.Definitely, not worth the money!"
1,"Enter key started making noise on 5th day and stopped working very next day. I have returned the product. Do not go for cheap products if you are working professional or your work totally depends on keyboard. Its only for casual home usage, not heavy usage. Gamers don't even add it to your wishlist."
1,"Not working properly, better don't buy this product. As soon as we started using the mouse, we found it is waste product. I suggest don't go for this even if they give for freee."
3,"Apart from having few letters T, V and E getting repeated despite being typed once,apart from this one issue it is good purchase, just need to be doubly careful with the spellings. May be the keys sensitivity is set to high ..."
2,"Both keyboard and mouse are noisy. Both miss keystrokes and mouse move about 1 of 5 times. This makes it difficult at times to pin point and click with mouse as it needs few extra moves to adjust. I still do not know how to use the rupee symbol as it does not have ""Alt Gr"". Maybe it needs some settings."
5,"Combo is nice, only one thing missing in the keyboard is palm rest, but considering its price it's good enough for smooth and silent typing. Decent mouse. Really love using it."
2,"Mouse stopped to recognize and got fixed since under 6 month warranty, customer service adviced to take it to service center to fix which is a pain. Now keyboard has loose connection. Mouse gorgeous repair again after six month, now out of warrenty."
3,"Few buttons were not working and there was some whitish thing on the product/wire, may be a manufacturing defect. I was too busy with work to have it replaced, now I need to look into warranty thing to get it replaced, hopefully I get it replaced by the manufacturer. overall, I'm not happy with product other then that it was affordable."
5,It is a good enough keyboard and mouse for your casual work. Not for gaming but the normal work is completely fine with this. Also the mouse is comfortable to hold.@349 it's value for money.
1,The product is not built with quality in mind. I have ordered twice from this brand and both times I was required to exchange the item due to malfunction. On this one for example- the ‚ÄòO‚Äô key just would not work unless you applied extra pressure on it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend purchasing this for work at all as you will need to go back and make changes to the email / document.
5,"Comfortable keyboard keys, Just as new design keys. Mouse also so comfortable within hands. Click & scrolling is better than any other same range mouses. Don't need to think twice... Just Buy it. ‚ù§Ô∏è I bought these combo item in ‚Çπ469 INR only in ( Deal of the Day sell ). Delivery is also superb. Also, Amazon always deliver his best.Thanks Amazon ‚óâ‚Äø‚óâ"

5,Zinq is an Indian brand. I would say quality of keyboard and mouse are of very good quality. Stylish and sleek as well. Highly recommended.
4,"Its great for the price, because u r getting mouse and keyboard, but little bit stiff keys. Ease is bit less but hoping it will be fine over a time of use"
2,"First I replaced it as the mouse was missing in the package. Now the keys ""W"", ""T"" and ""L"" aren't working properly.Sometimes the keys never respond and sometimes when clicked once, the letter gets typed twice.Not sure how to return this off as the return period is over."
1,"Please Don't buy any zinq productVery bad service.I have buy the product after 2 months my product stops working and product are in warranty. Still, they are told me we are not responsible.Thanks"

5,Good product my brother is using the this and he is very happy with the performance. If wifi keyboard mouse available then please give me as for review.
4,Its wired Chiclate keyboard. Comes with Mouse.Delivery  is Good and Product is light and compact to carry in Bag.Its not made for game. But good for typing.
5,I loved those keys and mouse is buttery smooth...In old reviews it may be bad but now they all had changed themselves and now they are sending a quality product at low budget...It satisfied my budget...
1,this product is fake I found about 7 keys broken and 1 scratch the quality was terrible made with plastic  in the image it was shown to be wireless I will return
1,"Very slow responded, not comfortable for Windows 10.No return only replace means again you will get same nonsense"
1,Not worth. Mouse shows frequent disconnections and its a waste.
5,"It's a wonderful Combo in this price range 469/- rs , keyboard keys are very comfortable, keyboard is light weight & thin, best for this price range, You can blindly purchase it.!!"
2,You must go for Amkette Xcite pro Usb Keyboard and mouse Combo best value for money
4,"I would say this one is ok for money, but keys are not silent keys and mouse also not a silent, and mouse scroll bar not properly working its hard to scroll, over all average ptoduct."
5,"Value for money , initially I was little but confused that will it be good in condition and in working , but the moment I received it I was really very happy and surprised - it really is a good product and worth every penny it does done work nicely üíØ"
2,Started facing issue within two months. Not recommended
1,"Don't buy the product quality is poooor,  USB almost Dead,  wire is a jock.. I suggest buy a brand like HP, dell etc."
1,Left Shift key is hard to press. All keys generally hard. Not smooth at all. I have many keyboards and this is the worst. Next time I will not fall for cheap plastic junk. Lesson learnt.
4,"Pros :1.Small in size , handy .2.Easy to carry , Overall quality(3.5/5)Cons :1.Buttons are tough ( Will become smooth after long usage hours ).2.Usb port is rough to use"
4,"It's very light weight keyboard and not for professional. The beginner can use this for their small work. The keys are not smooth. Wire length is sufficient for use.The seller send it with no packaging, it delivered with its original box. I get this ‚Çπ315."
5,Button pressed easily
1,"As I Unboxed This ZEB-KM2100, I Found That It Is Made of Plastic That Is Not Durable. A Small Force Applied At Its Ends  Tends It To Bend. Strong Force Is Sure To Break It.Okay, I Understand That I Should Not Expect Durability For The Price I Paid - ‚Çπ290.Its Keys Are Soft. It Is Light Weighted. It Worked Fine For 10 Days. 11 Day, Its 'Soft Keys' Became So Delicate That On Single Keypress, It Types Same Letter Twice (As Shown).Don't Buy It Seeing Its Price, You'll Be Disappointed. Go For Other Reputed Companies Like Dell.If You Doubt My Review (Including Screen Capture), Ignore And Go Ahead Buying It - Happy Buying :)"
1,The keys stop working and don't respond for few minutes. For 5-6 days the keyboard worked very well... But now i m facing such problems. Unsatisfied with this product üôÅüôÅüò†
5,"Review after 1.5 months, this keyboard is awesome, because you can use a new keyboard at such low price, although i bet it wouldn't last more than 6 months of rugged use, but it will run fine till 6-8 months of rugged use, mine came broken (just a little bit of corner), so did everyone else get a broken keyboard nonetheless it's great, it's a great substitute for those ‚Çπ600 dell keyboards which are sturdy(if you can't afford one like me). This keyboard will easily last more than one year on normal use. It's extremely lightweight, compact. Smells like all those other cheap Chinese toys and gadgets do from inside when it's new, the keys are flimsy and after few months of usage you would have to press extremely hard on the keys for it to work. The keys are of extremely cheap quality kept in a socket, but works great, no locking mechanism but keys won't fall off. Overall an excellent keyboard replacement. Works for me I don't know if it works for others or not, don't expect fast inputs from this keyboard, this keyboard even takes about few seconds to connect, so not for gaming obviously."
5,"I am a regular user and I loved it!Reasons:1. The major reason to love this product is it makes no noise! It's quiet. I do not like that 'khat-khat' noise when typing. I am an extremely fast typer and the noise would have become unbearble if it made any! Thank god for that! I was looking for exactly this kind of keyboard.2. The overall size is not too small, neither too big! It is just perfect for personal use.3. I am not a gamer but I hope to use the multimedia keys for watching movies etc. If you are buying this for regular use at uome or as a substitute for your laptop keypad, go for it!"
1,The worst product I have ever seen on amazon. Keyboard was broken at corner. Worst keyboard. I had never written a bad review like this any time before.
1,"Budget keyboard with iPhone 6 features.Offers more than expected.Backspace key works only on 'very hard' press, and other keys work only on 'hard press'.Soft Press is like child-lock. No matter which key you press, nothing happens. Tap the beats of your favorite song while staying assured that not a thing will get typed(except 'L'). You could record the sound of key-presses and play it to get a typewriter effect.The 'L' key has feather touch... You type one 'L' once and you get two extra 'L' printed, absolutely free.The spacebar key has a nice upward slope as you slide your finger from left to right end.Compact, budget friendly. The kind you would find in Cyber Cafe.Guess what, its the ""Zindagi ke sath bhi, Zindagi ke baad bhi"" kind... As you CAN NOT RETURN it.Got it 30mins ago, just realized it has a replace-only warranty.Ordered it for WFH, but it turned out to be utter crap.Keys are so densely packed, and they don't work unless you put in an extra effort.It would be a steal deal for people who do all the typing with one finger only.Rs. 350/- wasted.... Willing to sell it off on OLX in 100rs.@Seller: you may take it back for free and sell it again to someone who might need it.#Peace"
3,Pros+Lowest price.+Full function wired keyboard for personal computer and laptops+ Zebranics brand produces good products at affordable prices.Cons15% smaller than a regular keyboard. Space between keys is less.So I face a little bit of discomfort while typing.Built quality is not up to the mark. Don't expect better quality at this price.The packaging is also not secured. In transportation high chances are there for damage.I can't excuse in proper packaging. Amzon must take care of packaging. Particularly in this product.
4,"Zebronics keyboard which has 12 multimedia keys, easy access to the music within the keyboard, volume up and down buttons are user friendly. It has a special Rupee key symbol which can be easily accessed, the USB cable is also pretty decent connects easily to any kind of computer and laptops."
1,"Not worth for even a single star, Exactly after 2 weeks of buying it, just found that if we have to move the keyboard frequently then for  a while the keyboard stops working due to some wire problem, the connecting usb wire is too hard and it got cracked at the joint of usb and keyboard , i have done jugaad and applied m-seal at the joints to stop wire from cracking more but all in vain as the portion covered is now ok but after that it started cracking again, the design is such that you keep pressing multiple alphabets simultaneously untill you get used to it ."
2,"For me, when this item was delivered, the shipping box seemed all messed up. But that didn't alter my expectations at first.But, this keyboard actually seems like completely old stock inside out. As soon as I took it out of the cover, the left Alt key cap came out üòÇ. Also, the space bar stays pressed. Yes, it is light weight. I did give a replacement request in Amazon, but the keyboard seems to be released a long time ago too. The reason why I'm saying is mainly because of the logo on the Windows Start Key. Microsoft dropped this logo a long time ago with the release of Windows 8. Since then, most of the keyboards which came out feature the new Windows logo on their Start Keys. And all keyboards completely shifted to the new logo with the release of Windows 10. But this one still keeps the old logo. I did notice that the Month and year of import is October 2019 on the box. And I'm writing this review in October itself. That doesn't deter the fact that this might have been released long ago.I bought mine when Amazon was offering this item in a lightning deal of Rs. 209. Anyway, it's hard to expect something more from a keyboard worth Rs. 200. Might have been a good keyboard if the product was fine at least."
1,"IF YOU ARE GAMING ,YOU KNOW  U NEED SHIFT AND CTRL KEYS ALWAYS PRESSED EXAMPLE FOR MINECRAFT AND ASSASSINS , BUT THIS KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOESNT SUPPORT IT , FIRST ORDER THOUGHT ITS MANUFACTURER FAULT AND REPLACED RECEIVED SAME TYPE AGAIN , ALSO INSTALLED DRIVER FROM ZEBRONICS SITE NO LUCK , FINALLY APPLIED REFUND AND ORDERED DIFFERENT KEYBOARD FROM DIFFERENT BRAND . ALSO THERE SOME OTHER ISSUE LIKE IF SPACEBAR PRESSED SOMETIMES IN WINDOWS NOTIFICATION BAR POPS AND MINIMIZES EVERYTHING NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE DOING , SHIFT + W DOESNT STAYS CONTINUES , IF PLAYING ASSASSINS CREED YOUR PLAYER WILL STOP RUN STOP RUN IF SHIFT + W PRESSED , SAME FOR MINECRAFT WITH CTRL + W . DIDNT EXPECTED FROM ZEBRONICS FOR SUCH PATHETIC PRODUCT ."
1,The quality is very bad and its not even solid like usual keyboards. I tried for return but its been upgraded for replacement. I don't understand why this is happening? You must allow customers to return item and give them full refund.
5,Good working condition and received safe and perfect product on time. Keys are smooth and auto installation made easy to access. Would suggest anyone to buy it.
3,"Keyboard quality is not that great, but okay for this price range. The position of the keys are slightly different from other standard keyboards, for example ""backslash"",""home"", ""end"" and ""enter"" key are wrongly positioned. Keyboard is a bit smaller but it is okay for me as long as the keys are properly positioned. It doesn't have a good grip, so we may have to place something underneath the keyboard if you are using a glass table.Bottom line:This may not be suitable for heavy typing or gaming but should be good enough for normal/light work. This can serve as a replacement keyboard for kid's computer as they tend to break the keyboards on regular basis."
5,"With the mark of Zebronics, purchasers need not have to worrry about a thing! The key board nicely fits to my working table, with its size is a little higher than the keyboard size of laptops. Any adult can easily lift and hold the entire keyboard and operate the keys using just the thumbs. If there is one thing that is highly interesting about this product is its chic design and its ideal size. Not to mention its functionality.  I can race my fingers across the keyboard with ease. If you are looking for a soft touch keying, you will be disappointed, but by using for a few days, you will get used to it. The one feature I dislike in this product is the ""home"" button is given below and the ""end"" button is given above. But, this is not an issue because the same keys can be operated in the rightmost portion of the key board, wherein the home button is above and the end button is below."
5,"I have been using this keyboard from more than 3 weeks.The keyboard came in a well mannered package.The best thing about the keyboard is, it is small in size and can be handles easily.All the buttons are working properly. The keyboard comes with a usb cable attached to the keyboard. The cable is neither too long nor too short.I have a lot of writing work to do, hence a lot of typing needs to be done and on these days of using the keyboard; I have not found any issues with the keysI had a lot of mixed emotions before buying this keyboard because the number of negative reviews here is more than positive.But the good this is:1) The delivery was on time.2) Keyboard came in a well packed condition.3) Keys are stable working.4) USB cable is working accurately."
2,"Pros-----> Cheap & expendablecons-----> Stiff keys and they get more stiff after usage of just 10 days.> Worse keyboard when it comes to ergonomics> Enter key is a flipped design which means the bigger portion of the Enter key is on the top portion due to this whenever i hit the enter key my pinky lands on the backward slash key which is very annoying> Key top wobbles a lot which means keys will live only for a short period> Last and the most hated thing about this keyboard is its placement of arrow keys, as shown in the image the arrow keys are not aligned properly so definitely you don't feel like using them a lot."
3,"Overall it is a good product if required for non-critical home use.However, It has been only couple of weeks after I purchased this keyboard, , and few  keys have caught moisture. because of which after pressing those keys, they get stuck inside and doesn't release on their own. So Now  I am having hard time while typing important emails.Pros:1. Cheap cost2. Keys are not NOISY at all.3. Matt finish on the surface saves the keys from fingerprints.4. Sleek design.Cons:1. Poor material as the cost is less, and hence may not have long life.2. Not reliable while using it for critical work."
2,"'Zebronics' Company has carved a good name for it in gadgets & utilities. BUT, this keyboard product is a tragic downfall.The keyboard though is nice in first appearance, has very hard key-presses, which make it a pain to use, and spelling errors start happening as one types because some keys don't get pressed by even pressure of the fingures.In a nut shell, the keyboard is just like a good looking 'toy' instead of being a useful and ergonomic utility.Unless, Zebronics change the base of the keys-- so as to make them work evenly with same fingure pressure, this product is a waste of money for serious utility buyers."
2,"One of the most entry level keyboards. Extremely flimsy material, and should be handled with great care, else this may not last a month. First item delivered had a faulty 'R' key that needed lot more pressure, and an 'A' key which seemed to be somewhat tight in it's key well compared to most other keys, so in case of fast typing 'A' would be missed 4/10 times and 'R' would be missed 9/10 times. USB cable is very thin and flimsy, but not much worse than the keyboard itself. USB cable is about 1.5-2 feet long, so don't expect to be able type at a distance from the computer case. Ordered a replacement.Updated 13-Mar-2021: Some of the keys have become lot less responsive, i.e. I need to hit them several times or very hard for the entry to be recognized. Also at least 2 keys ('A' and 'R') are such that pressing them ones, leads to frequent multiple entries. Suggest staying away from this keyboard!Note that I bought that to use with few servers behind a KVM switch, which will run mostly headless, so the usage would be very very light. For anything more I'd never buy this keyboard, but spend a bit more money."
2,Keys are not at all good and cannot type fast as the keys are shaky. Took it attach it to my laptop for fast typing but didn't met the purpose.
4,"I got this product for INR299. Price to Perform Ratio is decent.I haven't added any pictures but believe me it's a genuine review after 15days of usage.Pros -1 - The price if the keyboard is quite decent. (INR299)2 - Main pros about this keyboard is it's a Full Size Island keyboard.3 - It has big size Left Shift, Left Enter and Right Shift Button.4 - Button Order and placement is also decent.5 - Keystorke and Response is also decent. (At this price can't expect mechanical or semi mechanical like button response).6 - All Button Works wih Windows 10. All multimedia buttons also works.Cons -1 - Weight is not that high. (Don't get me wrong about the sturdyness of the Keyboard.)2 - Doesn't have Palm rest.3 - Cable quality is not that high. *Feels cheap to me.4 - Power consumption is also good on laptop.Let me tell you if you're a fast typer or if you have work which needs fast typing then this is not for you. This keyboard is for general usage and for general people. The price on which i got this keyboard is good. Can't expect much.I hope I answered your queries. :)"
3,"Product was delivered in good condition and on time. Packing was done good. However, the wire of the keyboard is very short. If you want something which requires access to a bigger area/table, this is not the one. Also, I'm facing an issue with the Ctrl + c command. IT should copy paste when we use this but instead I get print screen option. Out of ten times i used this command, I got the wrong print screen. Restarted my pc twice, toggled the the property in cmd as well, however, I'm not sure what is exactly wrong. I tried using a different keyboard and this issue never presented with that keyboard. So I either got a defective product or there is a command issue with this one.All in all, an okay product but I will never be buying this product ever again."
1,"After 1 day of use, many of the keys are hard / getting stuck (important keys - TAB, CTRL, BACKSPACE, ARROW KEYS, and some letters as well)I had purchased this product from Amazon earlier and it was fine. This time the quality is very poor. Unfortunately I opened it after 7 days so it is outside the return window.ZEBRONICS' 'warranty' is a joke - they expect you to commute 40 kms and spend 100 rupees to 'show' them a Rs. 400 which they 'will inspect' and possibly decline replacement!Last time I buy such cheap products. Better to spend double the amount and go with trustworthy brands that have sensible service."
2,"I bought this keyboard a few days ago. I find this keyboard very light, the good side is i like the special buttons for volume control, media player etc. The sad part is the keys are not very good or say very poor quality and some keys have already started to not work. I have press it hard to get the number or letter. The length of the usb cable is just 1mtr whereas other keyboards provide atleast 2 meters this really does make a difference in the long run.Overall i would say its only worth what you are paying it for. Okay for average use but for serious use not a good option."
5,"Don't go for high end brand when you have many benefits in this range. Keys are very easy to press. Lightweight ,compact design And have long cable to move easily and freely. Using for past few months. But as it is very light weight because of the body material so Use carefully.No gaming experience"
1,"I thought it will be a good cheap keyboard. It was cheap but not good. That's the problem it's just too cheap to be of any use. The keyboard is tok light to stay in place, the keys are very bad, typing experience is horrible. The keyboard is so flimsy that it flexes with a simple key press in the middle. Ultimately you get y what you pay for. Font buy this, you will struggle to use it. I couldn't even return the product, apparently I was only getting the option to replace it."
5,"Had received a faulty product. The keys were so soft that one touch would result in multiple entries of fame alphabet. Requested for replacement and got a new piece the next morning itself. The new keyboard is working fine now. Five star for product, 1 star for quality check procedure of the seller, five star to seller for quick response and replacement action"
1,"1. Layout of keys is absurd. Just to save an inch of space, the Delete, Home, End etc buttons are placed in a random order vertically.2. Keys are very sticky. Initially I thought the keyboard would smoothen after some use. But after three months the keys are even more tight and hard to press. In a typing flow, we miss many keys and have to retype them.3. The plastic quality is so poor that keyboard bends in the middle. Seems it can break any moment.4. Definitely not a gaming keyboard. Even I won't recommend anyone for typing purposes.Better to go for a slightly higher price keyboard. This one is really wastage of any money."
3,"This keyboard is very light weight with minimal material used for its making. The keys are soft, responsive and feels good for typing. A host of multimedia controls are available at the top which I must say this is the cheapest multimedia keyboard I brought to date. But if you are a person who type a lot then better pay extra & get yourself a high quality keyboard. This keyboard seems it won't last two months if you keep hitting hard on the keys. If you have a basic PC for which you need a keyboard for general use then its fine."
5,"I odrered this for my laptop. Came in a brand named cardboard box pacaking which we normally get when buying electronic items. But product is intact. Length of thr keyboard is 41 cm, breadth is 12.8cm and height is almost 2cm""(including key protrusion ).  Letters and symbols on the keys are coated well. I tried to scratch the letters on the keys with my nail and did not came off from the keys.ligh weight keyboard. Keys are soft touch too. Over all good product for normal usage"
1,"I've been using computer peripherals keyboards since the year 2000 and this is the worst one I had the misfortune to buy.It has been only a month and the keys gave up. Ctrl, Alt and Num lock keys stopped working altogether. Rest of the keys needs to be wrestled with a million times before giving any sound character outpit."
5,"Though got a damaged one and had 3 keys fallen to the right side of the keyboard in the package, I managed to put them back and keyboard worked perfectly, so kept it without asking for a replacement. Request the seller to be careful in future shipments.The keyboard worked perfectly and loving it, fit and finish, quality of plastic, cable and connector seems to be quite good for the price. My purpose for occasional use with laptop."
1,"This is the worst keyboard ever. It sells so cheaply for a reason - quality comes at a price. You're better off using a Windows on-screen keyboard, and click away at it with a mouse. You'd still be faster and more accurate than this keyboard.Pros: It's cheapCons: It's cheaply sold, cheaply made and performs cheaply. The key positions are different, which is understandable as it's not full sized keyboard. But the worst quality of all is the hardness of the key press. For a fast typer, it's so hard to press common keys like Enter, Backspace or Delete that your fingers start cramping up.You're better off burning your 200rs than buying this keyboard. It's the absolute worst"
1,"Do not buy this piece of garbage- very cheap quality- keys getting stuck within 1.5 months of use- shape of enter key is weird, different than normal- Not returnableI agree it is small and light but still cons outweigh these by landslide.Verdict: Don't Buy. Invest some more and have peace of mind."
3,"I needed a basic keyboard to replace my old logitech one. The zebronics multimedia keyboard is good value for money and comes with added hot key controls such as sleep, wake up, volume up/down and system shutdown.Will highly recommend to anyone looking for a cheap and basic alternative to the more expensive keyboards in the market.Edit 3-Dec-2020 - I am cutting down 2 stars because I have had issues with the keys not responding or they tend to type multiple times for just one keypress which is a headache. Unplugging the USB connector and connecting it back seems to fix the problem, but only temporarily"
5,"I recommend you to buy this keyboard. Because within Rs. 200 this keyboard works very good.On first order i bought damaged keyboard from seller, but Amazon immediately replaced it with new and perfect keyboard of zebronics.Key are soft. Dont waste extra money to buy others keyboard as this keyboard solve everything."
1,Don't take anybody this is the waste keyboard and mouse don't use this model please try another models
5,"Mouse is very comfortable and Size is really Big..(comparison pictures attached)Previously I was using Zebronics PRAXIS keyboard.. wanted to buy that, but was not available as it is discontinued by Company."
3,Nice and awsum product....
4,Product is good and very useful. Plastics also good quality. Mouse has trouble working on bright surface whether opaque or semi-opaque mouse pad. Had to buy a dark color mouse pad Rs. 40.Kids drop the mouse more 100 times from a height of 4 feet but every time it survives very nicely !!
5,"Very good product does its job, cost effective also."
5,Great product for value for money.Plastic quality can be improved for keyboard but mouse is pretty good.For daily use it can usable.
5,The keyboard and mouse is very good for your everyday use. I bought it because my laptop's keyboard was not working and it does the job very well.
5,beautiful & awesome
5,Got it as a back up to my wireless keyboard n mouse when system crashes. Coz it happened recently and wireless was useless till I got windows reinstalled at a vendor.Good finish and fell of plastic. Immediately connected which is nice.Using mouse for my laptop which is nice breather to the mouse pad.
5,"Normal, no negative impact... usefull for continues working"
5,"Excellent than expected üëç. Good quality.One thing like a suggestion is that, keyboard and Mouse wires are like very thin, consider a little thicker wire.Overall the product is superb."

5,All good but key are more near to each other but nice product
2,"The  keyboard quality is great at this budget point. The lighting features  are also good. Keyboard feels  sturdy, though slightly heavy. For gaming,  this is perfect  as you wouldn't notice much the lettering on the keys. But there are  certain aspects that annoy me a lot.1. The printing on the numbers are too bad and you  won't be even able to read them without turning the backlight on.2. The lighting of the NUM, Caps and Windows  lock keys are way too bright that it hurts the eyes3. The  biggest concern till now is double spacing. While writing this review itself, I was able  to get 10+ errors for double  spacing, still  you cannot do anything  about it. That's very irritating. I am not even going to edit those spaces so that you can see the result yourself.I would recommend  to spend some extra bucks for  a better gaming keyboard. I'm stuck  with this for now.,"
5,"It's a decent keyboard with some good premium features. The build quality is quite good. considering it's low price, i was actually surprised seeing the build quality.Raised keys will give you mechanical keyboard like feeling.However it's a normal membrane keyboard.The LED's are very good ,it's bright but at the same time doesn't hurt your eyes. This keyboard can give  you a premium keyboard's look and feel.It doesn't look cheap at all like other competitors in the same price range.To be honest i didn't find any cons.However i would like to mention the following points if you considering to purchase it1) People are saying in the reviews that Printing on keys is not visible.Well it's true, but there's a reason behind it. Those letter inscriptions are actually transparent so that the backlit LED's can be easily visible. So keep in mind that you need to turn on the LED's all time in order to use this keyboard.Otherwise you'll face difficulties seeing the letters.But in my personal opinion nobody looks at the keyboard while typing as soon as they get used to with a particular keyboard.So, its not a con for me.2) Num Lock indicator ,Caps lock indicator and windows lock indicator LED's are too bright(blue color and you cannot change the LED color for these 3 LED indicators) and really hurts your eyes  because they  are pointing directly at your face. This can be very irritating at night time.3)Instead of violet ,they could go for Green LEDs for the 3rd color option.It would have been great.Now coming the the seller's service and delivery. I have no complain about the delivery time, but the packaging was worst.I purchased it from a seller named Appario Retail Private Ltd .They sent the product without any protection at all, no cardboard box ,no bubble wrap... nothing !! Not even a plastic wrap. They literally send the keyboard directly in it's product box without any packaging.Due to this horrible packaging (if you call it a packaging ) one corner of the keyboard got slightly damaged.The paint came off from the metal and also there were some minor scratches(See screenshot). Fortunately the internals of the keyboard didn't get damaged and working fine. I request the seller to please give importance to packaging.I know it's a very low budget keyboard,still protection should be given during shipping so that it doesn't get damaged.Apart from this packaging issue the product was genuine and the delivery time was quite good.I'm happy with amazons Service."
3,"While the keyboard quality is very good and sturdy, the printing on the keys is not very good. The print has already started peeling off on some keys."
1,"Ok so guys I am not gonna lie about anything if you want i can even give you proofs about what I am going to write.So when this keyboard came to me and I started using this keyboard i noticed that the force required to press the space key IS TREMENDOUS (in terms of comfort while gaming ) the rest of the keys were fine and the space key was JUST BAD,I still didnt got used to it and it has been like 2 months (which is enough to get accustomed to ANY keyboard) you literally have to hit the jump key and still its delayed and whatever is assigned to your space key while gaming(jump in my case)that move is delayed and if you dont properly press it the move doesnt happen at all.TTTTTHHHHHAAAAATTTTTSSSS  NNNNOOOOTTTTT  AAAALLLLLLAfter 2 months of struggled use i am facing a new problem which is greater than that of the last one , my keyboard connects and disconnects randomly (this happened while writing the review as well) So in game if you are pressing W to move forward and the keyboard disconnects and the windows makes the default saound that something got disconnected and you start running into the direction which you were until the keyboard connects againBEST KEYBOARD EVER THANK YOU REDGEAR VARY COOL  ,ok so now lets talk about getting my money back"
2,"I expected more from  this keyboard.. My biggest concern is the spacebar.. It is ok for gaming, but pathetic when used for typing.. Even though you press space, sometimes it is not registered.. You  have to press harder.. When you  press harder,  there will be double spaces.. My old Aula  Befire  which i bought from ebay.in(shut down now)  was way  way better.. It was Rs.1500 in 2014 and served me well  till now and even now, it has small spacebar problem.. But this new keyboard has  more spacebar problem than my 4.5 year old keyboard.. And the letters  look of  lower quality...And the packaging  from  the  seller Appario Retail  was  just awesome..  The keyboard was sent as is without  any protection.. Just amazon prime tape on it.. Not even some plastic wrapping...Overall I am dissatisfied with this keyboard..  I don't understand how this keyboard  has 4.5 star rating..Just look at this review.. So many double spaces because i have  to  press harder and if I press lighter, it does not register...Update: Double spaces do not show up on amazon reviews.. I have learned to live with the keyboard.. And after breaking in, the space bar has become better and double spaces are rare now.. However, it is still a problem.. So updating to 2 Star..."
5,"Whatever everyone says about this keyboard on the first day of review is true even after two years of using it. Till date I haven't faced any issues with this keyboard and it is as good as new and just to let you know how much I have used... I play pubg on emulators and my my pubg ID is off level 82... I bet none of you reading this has played that much of game..... All those game please have been played on this keyboard in last 2 years ,maybe a million on every button out there but none of them is even close to lose yet..... I just want to come up with the cons but they haven't left any page unturned..... Its durable beast...."
3,"Pros: 1. Looks good,2. Aluminium build,Cons: 1. Space key not working properly. Sometime it skips and most of the time if clicked double time.2. Font style of keys are not good.3. If you switch off the backlight, then unable to see letters printed on keys.4. Num lock light directly strikes at your face, makes uncomfortable."
4,"Bought on 14th Aug, 2018. Been using everyday ever since. Price is still justified for what it brings.Pros- Nice, braided cable.- Comfortable to use even in long sessions. Height adjustable.- Durable. Keeys seem mechanical but they are not.- Multiple LED color options. Backlit with 3 LEDs.- No key ghosting experienced so far.Cons- If LED is turned off, you can almost not see any key letters.- Gathers dust a lot compared to normal keyboard due to metal body and static due to LED lights. Keep it coveredafter use.- No hand rest.- Lacks multimedia keys, you will have to use the Function key combinations for them.- Keys become loose and make squeaking sounds after a while.- Heightened keys to make space for backlighting may feel awkward at first and may take some time to get used to.- More LED options would have been great. The Num lock and Caps buttons have fixed Blue LEDs.- Body is metallic, so improper earthing/cable could feel the keyboard have static feel. Dont use with wet hands."
1,"From the day first, I have been facing the issue of disconnection.I have tried on two different Windows Gaming PC and having same issue ongoing.I also investigated that it is not the issue from cable, or from the connector.its the issue from internal circuits, as when it disconnects it shows error in Windows Device Manager, mentioning that device descriptor request failed and windows could not recognise the USB device.But when again after removing the USB connector and connecting again it works again and disconnects randomly again.Also, the RedGear website has nothing related to the warranty. In fact there is no website of RedGear."
5,"I have had this keyboard for about 3 years now and I have been constantly using it (on several Linux based systems) for the duration. For most of the part, this keyboard is just plain amazing. I will try to give all the helpful details for you to make an informed decision.Typing Experience:First and most importantly, the typing experience. I have used this keyboard for typing a lot of articles and to do a lot of programming. Both of these things require a comfortable and fast keyboard. This product fit in that position very well. It is very smooth and has a decent amount of key travel. With a couple of weeks to get used to it, you can easily get really fast typing speeds. I have no complains or problems in this area whatsoever. This keyboard has served me well.Design and Layout:The keyboard has an aluminum base and plastic keycaps. It is very sturdy, with almost no flex at all. Most other membrane keyboards have keys that are uncovered at the base. Because of that, they accumulate dirt and the keys become sticky. This keyboard has keys that are covered with a white plastic at the base, which keeps the keyboard clean (performance viz) and provides a clean look.Now as for the design of this thing, it is beautiful. It has clean straight edges and well rounded corners. I really like the design aesthetic, but that is something that personal to everyone. The indication LEDs have an obnoxious gamer-y look, but it is not as noticeable in real life as it is seen in the pictures, so don't worry about it too much.Now we get to the first issue, that is the backlighting. No problem there, actually. The backlighting is great, you get three shades: red, blue and a pleasant purple. The lighting is uniform, sufficiently bright and looks really good. The issue comes up when you choose to turn the lighting off. The labels become almost invisible in that case. In most of the cases, keeping the backlight on at all times keeps the keys visible (especially the red color).The build quality for most of the keyboard is really well, which includes the cable. The cable is braided and will not get damaged easily. The only issue I faced was with the keyboard feet. I am someone who keeps the feet folded out, but after about 2 years, one of the feet gave in. The part of the foot that clicks into the keyboard broke, and now I have to use the keyboard flat on the surface. It is not much of an issue, but an area of improvement. The feet should be made sturdier.The key arrangement is pretty standard. Keys are well spaced, you can use it very comfortably. The enter  key at the center is huge, like it should be, the backspace is wide, like it should be. The right edge enter is very accessible, which makes it great to enter commands. The keyboard does make a a lot of noise, which is something that I honestly like. It is great to get that feedback, but again, that's something that is personal to everyone. The key depth is good, but it will take a while to get used to if you have only been using laptop keyboards.Conclusion:I don't have a gaming review, because I didn't do any gaming at all. But from the perspective of writing content and programming, this keyboard is amazing value for money. You will become very efficient after getting used to it a little bit. All in all, I definitely recommend this to everyone who has similar usage intentions. I hope this was helpful."
4,"Bought for multimedia works but not for gaming.Overall, this is a good product from the red gear brand for this price rangeRight now im satisfied but I‚Äôm ready to buy again if the redgear releases the next version of this keyboard by clearing all of the mentioned cons below.Pros- Solid build & Aluminium material- Premium looks- Clear letter visibility even the keys are not individually lit.- Works also with Apple Mac Pro workstation- Easy to change the colors and brightness - More colors in the blaze 7 version keyboardCons- Letters are not visible even in the room lightso always LED lights on the keyboard must be turned on to use this keyboard- No dedicated multimedia keys- Keystroke sounds are high- Need more height adjustment function- More led light is wasted under the keys bcoz of floating keys design(I think gamers won‚Äôt consider this point as a drawback)"
3,"this keyboard is bad, high ghosting, cant play action adventure game, had to buy new keaboard to play Devil may cry 4, better spend more and buy another one.key print quality is bad, print quality makes it look like a cheap chinese product. also they backlight is brighter near spacebar and get dim as you move upwards, making funktion keys completly unreadable.Keys are raised so high that when i type i hit bottom line keys while trying to hit top line kys, like my palm hits ctrl when my fingers reaches out for backspace, probably using the keyboard's back stand will help you, but it was no good for me.The feedback and feel is good. It gives a complete mechanical feedback. its made out of aluminum alloy which makes it sturdy. the cable is also braided which is rare in low price products. Its plug and play, you dont need to install any extra software to use it.If you still want to buy it, it will take you some time to get used to it. I am still trying."
4,"Aluminum body keyboard with fold able stands. Membrane light colour is bright, num lock, caps lock LED colours are bright but key colours are slightly dim. Very ergonomic and sturdy with good buttons/keys. Noisy like a mechanical keyboard when keys are pressed so not suitable to type at night when someone is sleeping close by but that's not a problem if the sleeper sleeps like kumbakaran. 7 colours with 4 level brightness and static or breathable mode. Good buy if on budget constraint!"
4,It my first gaming keyboard. Was skeptical about how the button would feel nevertheless thought of giving it a shot and it is good. The travel is good and the mechanical button like feel is there.The indicator lights for the scroll lock caps lock and number lock are a bit brighter than I would like.Three colour options on the backlight is nice would have liked it more if there was a way to adjust the brightness. Sometimes it feel that it‚Äôs too bright.Build quality is nice and feels solid. Cable is braided have good enough length. Packing was ok that it didn‚Äôt got damaged during transit.Definitely a good product for a beginner.
2,After the damaged one I received Amazon replaced me with another keyboard in a day but I didn't like the Key Board because of its usability. It is backlit but colours provided are not two vibrant to work with and the worst part is the readability of the keyboard even with backlit on especially the special characters on the Keyboard is bad as the transparency Levels are bad. You cannot work with it with backlit off even in broad daylight due to the poor readability of keys.Space between Keys is very less and often you press two keys together or the wrong key on the same account. Function Keys are also not performing as you might think again due to lack of readability and poor function assigned. I would say it is an expensive gimmick than a practical keyboard.
1,"I am using this Keyboard for about 5 months now. And after 5 months when I type, it types something else. When I press space it open up calculator. Looks like this keyboard has become faulty. Not sure if I can get a replacement.But giving a 1star now Becaue the Keyboard is not working well after 5 months, looks like monsoon moisture."
5,"It stands up to its name for semi-mechanical as the space bar includes two springs and a tension lever! The keys are so clicky and fast that you will get amazing going shoes and great gaming experience on this beauty! People say that it's 3 blue LEDs for the num lock, caps lock and win lock are too much bright and irritating but they do serve it's purpose as the keyboard is equipped with floating keys architecture, it would be hard to see the status LEDs of they were just regular ones. So, meaning them brighter and adjusted towards the user makes or easy enough to notice but not that irritating depending on the height of your keyboard table or the angle from which you use it! The keyboard is just amazing only flaws are :-1. The keys aren't visible without backlight.2. The keys aren't visible greatly in full blacklight either.3. You only get static backlit LEDs and not individual keylit LEDs!4. The metal base provided is pretty useless as it feels flimsy and breakable of your are very strong and if you lose control sometimes!Rest apart, this keyboard provides absolute experience to the user!"
4,"The keyboard overall is good in the current price range. Although, I received the product 2 days back and just noticed that a few keys were wobbly. I checked one of them and noticed that it was damaged from one side (pics attached). I immediately applied for a replacement and the replacement product is on its way. Hopefully that one will be in a good state.Talking about the features, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Nice feedback from the keys.- Keys make a little noise on press which is somewhat satisfying.- Lighting is good with 3 brightness levels and a breathing mode as well.- The keyboard looks good from all sides.- The connecting cable is braided and feels of good quality.Cons:- The Num Lock, Win Lock and Caps Lock indicaters are blue in color and cannot be changed.- Also, the indicaters are too bright and hurts the eye. (Seriously)- If you think the design would act as a palm rest for you, then let me be clear. It doesn't. It just looks good but is too small to act like a palm rest.- The elevation stands at the back are not too high and doesn't elevate the keyboard much.- The key printing is too light and is almost invisible without the back-light on.- Lastly, if you are adapted to your  laptop keyboard, then it may cause you a little trouble, as some keys like (Fn, Enter) are not exactly at the same place XD (not a major issue, you'll get used to it)I hope this will help you to make your mind. :)"
1,"I want to know the genius who decided to place the \ key below the enter. While he was at it, why not also swap the delete and enter keys.This is totally unusable keyboard for touch typists due to bad placement of one key..worse its non returnable"
4,"The product is really good as per the budget.Pros :1. Mainly the backlit is good with the keys.2. The build quality is much better than other simple keyboards.3. The mechanical feel gives a nice touch to it. (But it's not a mechanical keyboard and not even the sound)Cons :1. If the indicators light will be colour changeable with the backlit and the brightness balanced with the backlit, then it'ld be awesome.2. I don't know if it's about the product or just a manufacturing defect. But, the one I get, having a little standing issue. as it's not balanced on a flat surface like table. One corner is not touching the table properly... So, I have to use a cheap under a corner to balance it properly.That's all.If you wanna buy a sturdy, backlit, stylish keyboard for gaming and night time usage (in dark room) with a budget that suits your pocket. Then u must go for this.Thanks to Amazon for the product."
1,"Pros:It has good backlit and keys are also feel like mechanical, USB cable and connector is also of good qualityCons:You cannot use it without switching on the backlit because keys become invisible as shown in photoIssue:I purchased this keyboard for work from home amid covid lockdown on 24th of May 2020. After 20-25 days of use I have started getting issue that if I press a key (once) it keeps typing same letter for 10-15 times. For an instance if I am typing ""I have an issue"" it become ""I have an isssssssssssssse"" frequency of this issue is approx once in 100 words but become more problematic when it happens with backspace keyIt has no support at all, amazon has provided an email address where I have been sending emails and reminders for last 10 days but not luck.So you can go for it, if you guys are lucky enough and do not need any customer support."
5,Nice keyboard .. surely better than Logitech one. Smooth keys  and mouse makes no click sound. worth buying it.
3,"Good keyboard, gives you laptop keyboard like feel. Good response if you keep the wireless received close to the keyboard , but if you move the receiver a bit far the response becomes immediately sluggish. As an example moving the wireless dongle from one side to other side of my mac changed the responsiveness of this keyboard drastically.Backspace key is too slow - and I mean too slow, keeping it pressed doesn't speed up the deletion. Trying to exploring system preference to improve it. I did get improvement with keyboard and mouse response times by adjusting system preferences, but backspace still is bad. (Update: Its working fine for windows after I adjusted the settings in windows, I have yet to see this for mac - which is where I noticed the issue in the first place)The size of the keyboard is slightly smaller than the size of the standard keyboard so it will take you some time to get used to it.  And if you are thinking of this as a drop in and compact replacement for your standard keyboard, you will be disappointed because it will not give you the same feel, and switching between the two keyboards will be hard as the minor differences in the positions of the key between this and the standard keyboard will mean you will do more typing errors initially. But once you get used to it, it will be just fine. It took me 10 mins to get used to it.  (I know its a mini, I am comparing it with the size of standard querty layout)"
5,Absolutely perfect.. i wanted a sleek keyboard for my office computer without the wires and yet wanted a stylish keyboard which will catch the eye of every customer entering the office...and yes...it did the job..1)..it's working is good.. instant connectivity to my laptop and keyboard is absolutely silent and the mouse is absolutely noiseless. The mouse movement is easy and efficient. Both the keyboard and mouse work effortlessly and noiseless.2). The keyboard and mouse..both look eye catching and gorgeous.3). Easy to carry in my laptop bag in front zipper without any hassle..due to small cute size.4)one small issue i facd is my hands are big and fingers are thick...so i had issues of double typing many times and extra keys typing...but i am now used to it and the errors are reducing but for small hands..this should not be a problem.It's good buy. I am satisfied.Jai Hind
1,"Plus1. The key board and mouse build quality is very good2. Button clicks are awesomely smooth both in keyboard and mouse3. White and blue colour looks ergonomically beautifulMinus1. The are no page up / down, home and end keys. If you have lot of typing work then this would become difficult for editing2. Space-bar, enter-key and back-space are little bit loose compared to other keys2. The product seal was open when I received my package. I see yellow colour stain under the keyboard. In short this is a very good product from a bad sellerI am writing this review before returning this product"
1,"The mouse cursor movement isn't as smooth as it should be on smooth/glossy surface, keeps hanging intermittently.  But it is not mentioned anywhere in website description. I have lenovo/hp mouse which works without any issue on same surface. Also there is no on/off switch in mouse.Keyboard is Ok, not much smooth. Very difficult to adjust if you are used to work on laptop or normal keyboard. Right shift key is not at the regular place, it is on the right end.  Also, the keyboard misses keystrokes sometimes. There is no page up /down /home/end button.It is overpriced."
1,"Usually, I don't write reviews but for this product, I just want to share few things. Let me be straight forward, this is a TOY Keyboard. If you are looking for a reliable keyboard to get your thing's done, you'll make the worst mistake by opting this keyboard. Few points to consider - Design flawed, poor accuracy, and battery drained within 4-5 days of normal usage. For gamer's, it'll disappoint and rates for you'll be losing the game and for people trying to get your thing's done, it'll irritate and annoy for you'll waste all your time into corrections. Like I said, it's a toy keyboard to slap random on the keys. Go for branded like DELL or Logitech."
3,"Mouse is pretty good but its gonna take while to grab the hang of the keyboard, Keyboard is a bit heavy.Overall its a decent combo.Returned : Keyboard isn't that great."
1,"Worst product I ever bought. Don't waste your money on this. Some of the keys are faulty. Both shift keys on my keyboard does not work properly with some other keys. I emailed to their website, since it is under warranty, but they didn't respond. I kindly request Amazon India not to sell this type of ordinary product which doesn't provide support to the customer. I should have bought something like a Logitech with some extra money. Anyway I have learned a lesson."
5,The best buy ever........Portronics is not a leading branch in computers pheripherals but if you compare this product with any branded product..you will definitely not regret this buy....Keyboard and Mouse in a single receiver....Compact and awesome....Mouse is almost zero click sound....its a silent mouse....Keybaord is equally good....Definitely  go for it without a second choice....While other at a higher price will provide you with only keyboard..this provides you keyboard and silent mouse...Only drawback is the key board has no LED to indicate Caps lock...Num lock..however this will not be as issue if you use laptop...
3,"Writing this review the very 1st day. My initial impressions are good1. When I opened the box, I was disappointed to see a detached key ( right arrow key had got detached). I fixed it and it was working fine.2. Absolutely zero typing noice. Typing is silent. Some might not like it.3. Keyboard is a bit laggy when you type, but not a deal breaker. All the keys are working fine as of now.4. Mouse is accurate and sharp5. Plasticky, but sturdy.Last but not leastI did not find any ""battery included"" as advertised. Greedy seller migh have thought not to include for this price.For 999, it is still a bit expensive especially if the seller does not provide batteries. For my existing rapoo keyboard, the company had provided free and hight quality batteries."
1,"The keyboard was pretty good in the first month ,it took some time for me to get adjusted with the small keyboard. Other than that I didn't find any issues. But now, the number keys are stopped working,I have to press heavily to input the numbers to my laptop. Sometimes even that doesn't work. I can't use this keyboard anymore without the number keys properly working. Please go for a good branded keyboard guys."
1,"Just an initial feedback. Item was despatched on time and with good quality. Btmut the 2 AA batteries were missing;-( which is disappointing. I need to go out in this pandemic situation to use this key board and mouse that destroys the whole purpose of ordering online and when they dont deliver as per the item description.I will share the revised feedback after I start using it.Update of using it after 2 weeks (24Aug2020) :(1) the right shift key is actually available but much lesser in size and I just got used to it when compared to the normal key board.(2) there is a significant volume that comes with when working in the night time and I couldn't really turn it off on my Windows 10.(3) very important minus I feel is after a period of inactivity, the mouse loses its traction and connectivity which is good but I cant get it activated just by pressing any key. All I need to do is take off the  battery and reinsert it on the noise to make it work again.Kindly do suggest the best alternatives for the above points.Update - after using it for 3 weeks (06 Sep 2020)======================================Mouse is a gone case. Even during the active working duration now, for every click I need to take off the battery and insert it again. There is no switch to toggle it. Totally hopeless and I missed the return window in Amazon as well. I regret having purchased this product. Should have gone for a better one, even with a higher cost!!"
3,A good combo of portronics keyboard and mouse. The size of the keyboard is just the size of space occupied by the keys on a keyboard. The top portion has some extra area. A bit uncomfortable for those with long fingers who got accustomed to keyboards with space on sides too. Mouse doesn't have an option to turn on/off. I received the product without batteries and therefore -2 stars so that they might not continue this error again and look into this. Overall if you feel like you can get adopted with this size you can go for it as there are no more flaws in this combo.
3,"Bought it 8 months ago for my MacBook Pro Dual screen WFH setup.Initially, I found great value for my money. Thought a much better alternative for expensive brands like Logitech, etc.  The mouse wasn't noisy but smooth enough. Keyboard gives you a nice feel while typing. Handy function keys.After a long use, I do not feel this is a reliable partner, especially if you are programmer or write long reports like documentations and proposals. Why?1. Constant missed keystrokes.2. Sometimes a single keystroke might print something twice.3. Although the keys are big enough, they are cramped very closely. Might not be a problem for all, but if you have broader finger tips, could be you constantly keep making mistakes unless you have an auto-correct or spell checker enabled.4. Perfect for Windows, but if you use an Macbook, the layout and functions could be very confusing remembering the combinations.5. The mouse stopped working very recently.6. The mouse too would not register the clicks sometimes and sometimes registers more than necessary. Although this behaviour is quiet common in such class of keyboards, this is way too often and noticeable breaking your flow and frustrating you enough.7. The keyboard is showing signs of deterioration with this fault behaviour being more pronounced these days.If you're using a Wireless Keyboard and Mouse as primary input devices - like in a dual screen setup as I do - and heavy on typing and use a lot of shortcuts in working, this product could be placeholder until you find a better one but honestly, its not meant for professional grade workload.And the same could apply for gaming, because delayed and unnecessary keystrokes can change your gameplay and hence the outcomes."
5,"Good for moderate amount of document  typing and coding. Being a membrane keyboard, this is does not give you a good response while typing but it has very smooth and light buttons. After 2-3 months of daily extensive use, I can confirm that this keyboard is excellent for normal use.Right bottom side is a bit cluttered with to many keys; after all this is a compact keyboard.Mouse is awesome. It does not have a power button but goes to sleep after some inactivity. It's silent easy to use, comfortable size and nice scroll wheel.The keyboard hard some scratches on top right which was disappointing."
1,"The keyboard is small and compact. Same as the size of a laptop keyboard. Keys are soft and responsive. Looks are good. But, one huge mistake they did is misplacing the right shift key. There is a prnt screen key in place of shift and the right shift key is placed to the extreme end of the keyboard and is of small size which makes it difficult to reach and typing passwords becomes challenge. On/off switch on both keyboard and mouse would have been an added advantage.  How long this keyboard will last? Only time can tell us.  Another imp thing is this keyboard combo is available for 999rs on official portronics website. Here in amazon the price is 126rs higher. Amazon is cheating its customers in the name of prime membership. Which has become worst these days. Many of the items have etd of 5 to 7 days."
3,"This is a small keyboard apt for laptop but I am using it for desktop. Writing this review after 4 weeks of use.The WiFi plug is at the back of the mouse, take it out and plug it in to your usb port and insert batteries to the keyboard and mouse and you are good to go.It looks pretty and is noiseless but at times some keys get stuck and you have to manually push it up. Many functions of my old keyboard enter is now performed by the shift key of this key board. Mouse also gets stuck suddenly and can be very inconvenient when that happens.If you are used to the bigger keyboard, it might take some time for you to get used to this.When I tried to register warranty through QR code provided, it just wasn't happening.Ideal for laptop, but for desktop it is better to go for the bigger key board if you are used to that."
2,"Reduced the rating from 5* to 3*. Writing this review after 3 months of normal office usage.Pros1. Uses less space2. Keys are soft and accurate3. Keyboard battery consumption is much better than mouse battery consumptionCons1. The keyboard letter paint is getting faded2. Mouse, though is good but is a fuel guzzler that the battery consumption is very high (Duracell battery lasts only a month and everready lasts hardly 15 days). There is no way to switch off the mouse (auto off) but still consumes batteryI have switched back to old Logitech mouse as it has better battery managementIf I had an option to return, would have done so and have opted for Logitech wirelessOther than listed I haven't seen any issue with usage"
5,"Have been using since 3 and a half month. The keyboard is more like a mechanical toy with more than needed travel space. The mouse is great, infact I would say that it is better than the keyboard. It makes no sound on left and right click, however, if the middle mouse button is pressed, there is a normal clicking sound.The keyboard is completely water-proof. I mean it. Once I left it near an open window and it rained heavily. When I got back, I could see that water had enter the keyboard and literally ""filled"" the entire keyboard. I removed water by inverting it and let it dry. It kept functioning as it was.I use it on a macbook, so I feel that the control and function should be switched. Even if you configure the settings in mac, the control key or any other key just cannot function as the function key. So this was an issue. However the function key could be configured to function as control key, but then in some cases, it will still perform the functions of the function key!The right shift key is very small and not reachable. Programmers will find this annoying. The control key, as I mentioned, is on the extreme - bottom left and barely reachable, which is another thing that will bother programmers.Battery Life - I need a new battery for mouse every month(I use the laptop for 12+ hours a day). Didn't need to replace the cell in keyboard yet.On/Off Switch- Contrary to what few reviews have mentioned, there IS a switch to turn the mouse off. Just remove the usb plug and then press any button or just glide the mouse a bit and the light at the bottom will turn off. Keyboard has a long battery life and will not need to be turned off.Also it is a china-made product. It doesnot come with a setup manual. Both these things hurt!"
4,"Update after 3 month heavy usage (7-8 hours daily) , it's still working but battery backup is a worry. Keyboard battery lasted 2 months but the mouse one lasts hardly over a month. Just changed the battery on the mouse for 3rd time.If you are a daily user, you might end up buying new battery every month.Using this for the last 3 days. Pretty good for the price. The mouse feels light and fast. Keyboards buttons are nice and soft though the chocolate keys have bit too much play for my liking .I took the white and cyan tone which kind of looks vintage (in a good way)Both keyboard and mouse doesn't have an off switch but the mouse seems to go on a sleep after roughly 5 mins of inactivity.If you want to try out a wireless keyboard on budget, just go for it."
2,"I think i received an opened product. Batteries are fine, but no warranty card? Something suspicious. Also I can see that the QC sticker has been opened and placed again, i'm thinking someone has already done some repairs on this. Not to mention the product came all dusty with a fake seal.Let's see how it goes, if anything happens i'll return this asap. Feeling a bit worried if it will last long especially without the warranty card.Usage wise, mouse is good, but for keyboard, you need some time to adjust with the layout.Update 1: Mouse is good but keyboard is not that great especially if you are into programming. Also one key is not working. Thinking of returning this and buy Logitech. I bought this for the keyboard as i already have a Logitech wireless mouse.Update 2: Keyboard battery indicator is blinking. Its not even 1 week I started using this. Also mouse stops working intermittently. Very bad experience.Update 3: Battery died today. It has only been 1 week. Very bad experience. Hope amazon takes return."
2,"Good. But the size of right Shift and its placement is a big let down.I already own Logitech MK240 NANO (here onward Logitech) which has the same form factor as this one. I bought this Portronic only because of the blue color. Price was not a consideration while buying this.Plus points:Cheaper than Logitech if price is consideration.Note: Battery life may differ. I haven't tested battery life of both.It has capslock indicator. Logitech doesn't have.It has battery level indicator. Logitech doesn't have.Its nano receiver is ergonomically shaped. Its nano receiver has extra wing-like design and rough surface for easy grip while removing the receiver. Logitech receiver doesn't have this. Check pic for comparison.Portronics needs only 1 AA for keyboard and 1 AA battery for mouse. Total 2 batteries. (I am not sure if there is any older model which needs 2 AAA batteries. Mine requires only 1 AA battery)Logitech needs 2 AAA batteries each for keyboard and mouse. Total 4 batteries.Price of 1 AA standard quality battery: Rs 15/ piece. Rs 15x2=Rs 30Price of 1 AAA battery: Rs 13 per piece.  Rs 13x4=Rs 52.So, if battery life is the same for both the brands, then you save money on battery on Portronic compared to Logitech.By saying ""standard quality"", I mean non-Duracell or Energizer or similar batteries.There is no on/off switch on both keyboard and mouse. Logitech has on/off switch on mouse but not on keyboard. This is not a deal breaker. It is likely it has auto off feature. There is no mention of auto off feature. But the user manual says ""Five times more power saving than ordinary devices"".Minus point:Right Shift key is smaller than the standard rectangular size and is placed at far right. At the place where normally there is right Shift key, there is Printscreen key.It is very inconvenient for me as I have to use both shift keys a lot in my native language typing and also English typing. Because of this flaw, I had to return to product.One reviewer said the keyboard doesn't have Home and End keys. Maybe it was an earlier model. Mine was manufactured in August 2021 and it has Home and End keys printed on arrow keys.Suggestion: They should make the left Shift key standard sized, just like the right Shift key. Shift keys are used a lot for capitalization while typing.If they change the right Shift key to standard size and battery lasts as long as Logitech keyboard, then I think it is a serious challenger to Logitech.Lesson I learnt: Always check product pics and see the placement and size of keys like Enter, Shift. If you use Home/End keys a lot, then the size and placement of these keys are also important."
4,"I already own the very same product in green and white color that I have been using for my office laptop since the last one year or so. Now I have ordered it for my personal laptop and it finally arrived today. I must say that I am very satisfied so far. It hooked up very nicely with the laptop (HP Pavilion) and is working smoothly so far. In fact, I had some issues with the earlier version where mouse lagged behind a bit when switching from keyboard to mouse, but although its a small irritation, I have overcome it by always clicking the mouse once, before using it. That action immediately brings the mouse back to life. That action has now become so natural to me, I hardly ever notice the lag. This new set that arrived today, however, does not even have that issue. Mouse is working perfectly fine. I even set up my previous combo (the green-white) one to my personal laptop and the mouse worked fine there as well. So, I have come to the conclusion that this combo may work perfectly on devices with a high RAM (>=8 GB). I love the ergonomics of the keyboard and the mouse, and the fact that they are so silent and smooth to work with. I have re-purchased the same product for this reason only. The only reason I am deducting a star is because they did not include the batteries with the product."
5,"Oh boy oh boy !!!Bought this combo in a sale for lesser price, i was having a tight budget at that time and does not want to invest a lot on this techi, then saw this Portronics combo... I have been already using many products from Portronics and they are very reliable brand so went ahead and placed the order...I was so happy and amazed to see the product it came in good packing...- Small Keyboard (without NUM pads on right)- Noise less click mouse- Handy- Innovative- Light weight and easily portable- Best buddy for Laptop - Work From Home users- Keyboard keys are sooper !!! i like them a lot very soft and good feel when you type with out having a typewriter sound- I bought one more after using the first one which was RED and black (most loved), second one was white and blue which i am using for my Desktop..._ Big thanks to Portronics for the product and Amazon for delivering it*** NOTE: Product does not come with Battery, we have to use normal AA batteries 1 for keyboard and 1 for mouse... Happily it will last long no doubts on it"
3,"This is not suitable if you type a lot. The keyboard is smaller than in the photo. The keys are wide and evenly placed. But to accomodate all keys on a small board, a few keys like the Shift key on the right is moved from its usual position, which can be confusing. Initially, you will probably end up mis typing a lot of words.  Mouse is ok. I don't think it's very durable for longer run. I wanted a smaller keyboard, I don't type a lot frequently, and I purchased it for 800 Rs. So, I guess it worked out for me. Consider your main needs before buying this."
5,The plastic isn't the greatest ...The battery cap on the keyboard looks like a Chinese toy ( well it's made in china).Keyboard and mouse are extremely soft ..And that's why not at all suitable for gamingCons.Very soft keys .The reciver looks fragile.Slow Out of the box dpi.Pros.Looks great üëçThe keys are nicely spacedMouse is very comfortable to hold .Warrenty seems legitVery portableJust require 2AA battery (one for mouse/one for keyboard)Seems durable ( will let you know if it breaks ...I use stuff rough )I would recommend going for Logitech ( costs 500-1000 rs more)But I don't see the point wasting your money ..Overall. .go for it
2,"I bought this for my android tablet and it worked well from day one. I didn't have much complaints but only that neither the keyboard nor the mouse had a power off switch. I used it delicately but the space bar key broke just a month after the purchase. Otherwise, it's a fine product for the price. The mouse has teflon pads for smooth travel on any mousepad. The clicks on both the keyboard and the mouse are a bit wonky but, hey, you get what you pay for. The sleep mode is a bit aggressive as it goes to sleep very soon after you stop using(about 30secs-1 min) and you have to click it twice every time to get it back out of sleep. I'm giving this two stars mainly because of its durability. Everything else is pretty good for the price."
2,"The sleep profile on the mouse is very aggressive. If you switch between typing for sometime and then use the mouse, then the mouse remain unresponsive for couple of seconds until it wakes up. I wish both keyboard andmouse had switches to turn them on/off instead.Keyboard will occasionally miss some keys and might require some force to register keys. Also the shift key is an awkward position located to the right of the arrow up key. Both of these issues could be resolved by using this same keyboard for sometime, but not if you're switching different keyboards all the time.I will not buy this product again only because of the pathetic mouse."
5,The first order I received was a defective one. It dint have proper packing was half open with label on it . I was experiencing severe lags when backspace and some buttons are pressed . Was not able to work with that issues . They don't come with batteries though. It requires normal  AAA  battery . They offered me a replacement one for the lag issue.I loved it üòéIt came with the perfect packaging perfectly sealed . And works like charm. So far No issues . Red color is so highlighting compared to the white. My friend has white one.Its a perfect keyboard if ur looking for travel and fits easily in bags .One USB dongle for both keyboard and Mouse has solved my USB slot problem.The keys are sturdy too. The mouse is the best part of this. It's so sleek and makes no noise on clicking .No worries you can feel the pressure of clicking the buttons. It's so silent and responds very well even they share the same dongleYou won't Regret Go For It üíØ
1,"I purchased it for my kid for his online school.  Firstly, product was delivered without the batteries. As per contents description it should have been included. Secondly, after few days of use, the mouse has problems connecting to the dongle. The mouse stops responding whereas the keyboard works fine. The return/ replacement policy is already over so cannot get it replaced. I am really unhappy with product. I recommend buy a Dell / HP wireless combos."
4,"the mouse is not so ergonomic they tried to mimic the magic mouse by trying to make it flat. if used for long hours for gaming and stuff causes a little pain as there is not much support on offer.Keyboard is awesome very smooth typing experience with good key travel and spacing. Only drawback is no right control button which is of great use for single handed usage, and the right shift key is very small you end up typing the up arrow a lot so if you use the right shift key then this may not be right for youOverall, a good combo very satisfied battery life of keyboard is good mouse consumed the battery in 2-3 months"
5,"Some Chinese brands still stick to India because of this kind of product. Even lowest price the combo is decent and outstanding.What I liked:Build quality: Feels niceThe size of the keyboard, (11 X 5.5 X 3/4 Inches)Light-weight (350 g)Easy to carry in a daily backpack, laptop bag, office bagSilent keypress (except Spacebar key)Mouse buttons and wheel is really smoothRequired only two AA sized batteryGood wireless range (up to 8 meters I tested and works fine)No visible LASER flash in mouseAuto sleep if being not used for few minutesWhat I didn't like:No button to switch off the mouse or keyboard, If the dongle is attached to my tablet, a slight movement cause wake up the screen.The thing to ignore:Chinese product (I didn't find an alternate)No numerical keyboard, this is a small keyboard that does not have all the keys that you found on a full-size keyboard.Overall Value for money, Compact, Lightweight, must have."
3,"Everything is good except the packaging because the outer carton was damaged & also the batteries were missing as there is a slot inside which means the sellers open the packed products & take out the batteries before they dispatch the product.1.The product feels a bit plasticy but still the manufacturer has used good plastic.2. Buttons are smooth & big in size so I didn't find any problem while typing.3. Mouse is good, no clicking sound which annoys me a lot also it's IR so no red light which is also annoying.4. It's made in China so people who are against Chinese products please don't waste your money but if you consider product & not the country of origin than its a best option you can go with."
4,"Product looks attractive. Also Keyboard is compact in shape. Has nice smoother keys. Only drawback I found was the right hand side Shift key which is very small in size. Hence when if you want to type any capital letter, then it will be little bit difficult since I am used to normal keyboard with large Shift key and hence I dont have to find out the shift key, my finger automatically goes to Shift key. But in this keyboard, due to small size Shift key, It becomes little bit difficult.Otherwise product is really Good. Mouse is extremely good and silent, buttery smooth.One thing I want to mention is that the nano receiver can be found on the backside of mouse, near the  battery compartment."
2,"This was second replacement set I ordered. Keyboard is good undoubtedly.Mouse is the most disappointing. First one I replaced due to mouse intermittent disconnect.Next one also started doing the same. Initially I thought it might be my office laptop not getting compatible. I tried two other different laptop. Guess what! It's a bloody faulty mouse. Before I realised and return the product, the return duration got over ü§¶Moreover I could have read previous review before purchase.Found that I'm not the only one.CONCLUSION : Plz don't waste your money. Better go for good brand, rather than this crap brand."
3,"The keyboard key layout will take lot of time to get used to. Best for first timers. Keyboard is too small and layout is very different from standard keyboardsMouse is pretty good and has good ergonomics. Power saving works well.Both are very light weight.However, when I connected the receiver to Monitor USB Port (which is connected via USB Type C), i started seeing too much lag and missing keystrokes. Battery was new. Didn't try connecting to laptop directly."
5,"it doesn't have on/off.  But it goes to sleep on 3 minutes of inactivity.  if you are a hard user of the keyboard, then it's not the right one.  This is a tiny & easily portable keyboard for very light use.  The mouse is perfect the color and precision are completely good.The seller should provide batteries.  which was missing in my case.  Amazon customer care asked for a replacement.  But the package cost for replacement is more than the 2 AA-sized batteries it depends on you to go for a replacement for missing items.It is worth at its cost & I got the blue one for 989/- (batteries missing)"
3,"I have been using this product for over week now. Overall its a OK product. Keys are soft touch but it has some big problems with the key setup on the right -THE RIGHT SHIFT KEY IS HALF SIZED as compared to enter key. For users typing with both hands and having habit of using right shift key, this is highly inconvenient. It is almost impossible to press right shift and middle characters like y, h, n etc.Printscreen is in second last row. They could have skipped some of the worthless keys like right click and made shift key the same size as enter key.Mouse is silent, but the scroll ball has started making some noise when scrolling from bottom to top."
5,"Clicking sould null..i have logitech and protronics mouse..but protonics mouse very less sound almost null..there is no on/off switch but belive me power management is awesome.. just use the mosue when its need after that auto sleep..even after u are playing a video for long and mouse is ideal condition,then after 10-15sec mouse and keypad is sleep mode..awesome one..try it"
4,"ok, so I have been using this for 2 days now and its super good. Idk about battery life but it uses just one battery in each device so its not gonna bother much. The two cons are only that the spacebar makes very little noise but its very bothering compared to all other keys being silent. secondly if you use the right shift a lot you are probably gonna hit the print screen or up arrow key a lot. otherwise its a great product. although if your hand are big you might want to look for a bigger option. paired with a wrist rest it i can get upto 60 wpm."
2,"A month after receiving the wireless keyboard, the switch on the keyboard has started malfunctioning. The keyboard now works very erratically.I am unable to carry it the very long distance to the Logitech service centre in Andheri-East as I have a spinal fracture. So, to me this product has been a write off of the money spent. Logitech should not incorporate the switch on the keyboard. It is a component that is most likely to malfunction on switching it on and off every day. Can Amazon help me with a replacement?"
1,"KEY BOARD PARTIALLY STOPPED WORKING IN 15 DAYS... MANY OF THE KEYS ARE NOT WORKING ONLY MOUSE IS WORKING , WORST EXPERIENCE FOR ME AS SERVICE CENTRE IS 40KMS FROM MY PLACE NERUL TO GOREGAON ... SO FOR ME ITS LIKE AFTER GOING WITH BEST AVAILABLE KEYBOARD COMBO IM LEFT WITH MOUSE ONLY CAUSE ITS NOT PRACTICALY POSSIBLE TO GO 40KMS IN MUMBAI JUST FOR KEYBOARD ..."
5,"Great product.Pros1. On off switch on keyboard and mouse2. Caps lock indicator3. Shortcut keys like calculator sound etc4. Nano receiver5. Compartment inside mouse to hold nano receiver.6. Spill resistant,  has pockets beneath so that water that enters can drain out easily.7.Keys need very soft touch.Cons ( Not a big issue though)1. No num lock indicator2. Mouse slightly small than averageGo for it.Nice product. I got for 1499 in lightning deal."
5,"This is actually a keyboard which one longs for. Smooth and silent typing, perfect in size. Spill proof feature and the extra key rows on top are the best part of it. The keays are placed in a flat tray which has few small wholes under it to drain out the liquid, if accidentally some falls on the keyboard. Top key rows idea includes some dedicated keys for shut down, calculator, media keys etc.The mouse clicks are also very smooth and silent with an on/off button just like the keyboard, though its a bit small in size as compared to other normal sized mice. But, I think, its not a big issue, as you will get accustomed to it in a day or two.Lagfree connection and steady performance will surely win you heart very soon.Overall, a great combo. Just go for it."
1,"The Ordered product is different from the received one. We ordered key board with mouse, along with battries. ""Logitech MK270r Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo for Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Wireles...."". And the amazon standard packaging is aslo not there. We received simply the logitech cartoon normal taped on the both the ends, resulted broken keys in this wrong product. suggestion to the seller and the amazon, Please try to improve these. I have returned to replace the same ordereded product. let me see what they are going to send."
1,"Clearly, there was a clarification that this is a Logitech UNIFYING technology. The reality was that it was not. The biggest problem is that it does not allow me to return the product. Only an exchange. I do not want this product since it does not have the Unifying feature. I still do not know know to return this product and I am struggling, as of now. This is a highly overpriced product."
4,"Before saying anything, here is the list of pros and cons:Pros:1. Build Quality, Looks sturdy, and premium.2. Keyboard's keys are soft to press, good for typing.3. The range is great (About 6-7 feet in my case).4. KB and Mouse both have On/Off Key.5. The keyboard has a Caps Lock Indicator.6. The mouse has an invisible optical sensor that means more battery life.Cons:1. The mouse is so small if you compare it with other brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo2. The price is a little high.3. Battery compartment cover on KB and mouse are a little bit loose.(But it's not like they will open by themself. Not a deal-breaker)So the overall package is good and you can definitely buy it. Just remember that the mouse size is a little smaller than the regular one. So if you have a big palm like me, you have to adjust to it but you will get used to of it."
4,"I wanted a full size keyboard to carry in my laptop bag. Most compact keyboards have the layout like laptops i.e. mini arrow keys and cornered page up/down keys, which is illogical because who would buy a separate keyboard which is EXACTLY the same as the laptop's keyboard?Hence I bought this Logitech one which was at a discount in a lightning deal. The keyboard buttons are super smooth, once you press a key gently there is no friction and the key will be pressed all the way down, typing is so much fun with it. Although it is a full size keyboard, it is still a little say 10% smaller than a normal PC keyboard, hence I can easily fit it in my laptop bag.Both the mouse and keyboard use a common nano receiver, earlier I had a wireless Dell mouse and I didn't want to insert two separate usb receivers for both keyboard and mouse, this logitech combo serves that purpose perfectly.There are batteries provided in both of these but they are normal AA ones, I replaced them will Duracell AA cell immediately on unboxing.NOTE: I ALMOST RETURNED this product because I COULDN'T FIND the nano receiver initially. It was supposed to be inside the mouse, near the battery but it wasn't there, the receiver was inserted inside a corner piece of the cardboard outer box, there is no indication on the box where to find it, luckily I found it before I clicked on the final return button."
1,"I'm unable to write much about the product because I received it broken. Out of the box, One key on the keyboard was out. Clearly the packaging and handling was the issue.It wasn't packed in an Amazon package. The box was just wrapped with plastic wrap. I could see the impressions of keys on the plastic cover of keyboard. It must have been under other heavy stuff. I'm returning this!Giving 1 star because of the pathetic packaging and handling. Otherwise, the product gives a nice first impression. Quick word after 5mins usage- both keyboard and mouse look good and top-row multimedia keys work good for calculator, play/pause, volume etc. 1 con though- the mouse wheel doesn't give a nice feedback, bit greecy."
1,"I opened the package 3 days ago and initially for a few hours the keyboard and mouse worked erratically. The next day the performance became worse, to the extent that I cannot work on the keyboard or mouse at all. While typing on keyboard, the characters appear on the screen after a lag of a few seconds, and then too incomplete.Unfortunately for me, the return window is not open anymore even if I used the product for only 3 days.I used to consider Logitec a premium rand, but now I have lost faith in all Logitec products. Complete waste of money.Complete waste of money"
1,"I purchased this product based on amazon suggestion. Initial product delivery was in damaged condition, so I have requested replacement, they replaced the new one today on 2020-06-17, but all the keys are not functional. I have attached the keyboard test as well to show how many keys are defective.When I buy product on amazon, I trust that amazon delivers best, but this is very disappointing, I expect product should be top notch and in perfect working condition. Hope you will take care of it from the next time."
1,Worst keyboard ever used i thaught logitech is the best productbi can use as iam using a wired logitech mouse for more than 4years i baught it two month back on amazon sale after few days it stoped responding after some time same with the wireless mouse so i asked helpnin amazon so the help and refund returnable was for only 10days so last two days back i went to logitech service and respond is worst they replaced it with new but still am facing the same issue it stops responding after sometime even after changing the batteries
1,"DO NOT BUY this model. It was good initially, but as days progressed, keys have become hard. Only if you hit the keys hard, you will see the letter getting typed on the screen. Support? Warranty? Dont get fooled. Support phone number given in the website says ""Switched Off"". No Support or Warranty at all. Logitech fooled me big time. Ordered two for my office and both are giving me problems."
5,"Though I don't like the curvy design, but the product is working fine. No connectivity issue. Mouse is small for a big palm like me.. at first I purchased Amkette Wireless Keyboard and mouse combo which has all the functions like all the indicators and a big mouse, but the mouse had connectivity issue and I had to return that. This Logitech combo has only Caps lock indicator but is working fine. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
5,This is a very nice combo of wireless keyboard and mouse I ordered it from Amazon a few months ago and I am loving it.  Keyboard are nice and soft you will feel like that you are typing on a Laptop. The keys are very comfortable to use. The mouse is perfect with  Nice respond to the commandBoth On and off buttons are provided on both the keyboard and about and they work immediately after turning them on.There is no delay in the commands.  Go to keyboard and the mouse are active and fast to respond I love this product thanks Logitech for creating such an amazing  Logitech for creating such an amazing home comboü•∞
1,"It looks good, easy to carry and sturdy... But all that is worthless if the connection to the computer (or any other device) is bad....The dongle must be in line of sight for the mouse and the keyboard, else you experience a serious amount of lag. I ve tried changing the batteries to new ones and the problem still existsThis is what disappoints me..."
1,"After Missing the USB Chord on 1st order, when I replace, it is found that the arrow key of the keyboard is displaced to very far near 'A' button without unsealed the keyboard . Do you think it will ask for a rating ?"
1,"Does not type Upper Case K, P, D, & many letters. To type P we have to first type lowercase p and then replace that with uppercase P. Strange errors. Even after updating the software it wont become better. Updating is very difficult. The update software does not recognize that it is connected, even though it is connected. Strange keyboard of low quality. Local firms produce keyboards at cheaper price & of better quality."
5,"After 6 years, I've finally changed from my wired Microsoft keyboard to this wireless Logitech keyboard and this is my reviewPACKAGING: The packaging was good. It came in the Amazon plastic bag and had no cracks in it. The product reached me safe.KEYBOARD: My last keyboard had so much dust in them that they had stuck buttons which could not be easily pressed. This keyboard is like a blessing to my hands. The moment I switched to this keyboard, the keys felt so light to touch and has nearly no noise in them. The keyboard is large and keys are spaced right so that you don't mistype any keys. Also, the keyboard has a good alignment setting stands which makes it easier to type. The keyboard can be carried easily while traveling. It comes with 2 AAA batteries which promises to last 36mnths. The connection is strong and it works from every corner of the house. However, do not plan to use it for gaming as it's made only for office work/day to day activites.MOUSE: The mouse is great too. It's compact and lightweight and can fit most hands easily. My hands are a little big so I felt uncomfortable at the start but later it felt fine. The mouse response is good and there's no lag in response. Also, the buttons are easy to click and the wheel rotates smooth. However, they make click noise a lot. The mouse has a AAA battery in it which lasts 18mnths (per company). It also has a storage area for receiver.PRICE: I think the price is justified as you get 2 items for this price. An individual keyboard or mouse would cost you a lot.VERDICT: I think the keyboard is a must buy if you're planning to upgrade to wireless accessories and you need both devices.PLEASE VOTE HELPFUL IF YOU LIKED MY REVIEW"
1,"Logitech mk270r wireless keyboard mouse comboBought with very high expectations.1. The packaging was damaged as gou can see in image i attached.2. package seems to be already opened, batteries were already installed. One extra AA Battery installed in the mouse (not mentioned in package)3. mouse was already in ON mode with Aa battery installed.4. LEFT CTRL key was in the package  instead of being on the KB.5. ENTER key on the number pad is placed in reverse as  seen in image6. one battery installed in KB with other one and KB battery Cover lying loose in the package.7. The indicators in KB (caps lock), and mouse does not seem to light up.8. The USB RECEIVER missing from its place inside the mouse. so couldn't check whether working or not.didn't expect this from amazon. could have got the same from reliance digital delivered at almost the same price from the nearest outlet.Anyways applied for a replacement (as the product seems to be non returnable. shall update my review after i get the replacement."
5,- Soft keys press like butter- long battery backup 2 years for the keyboard and 8 months for mouse daily usage 8-9 hours except for sunday I'm using the same set of the keyboard since 2014 it's my next purchase.- No lag in connectivity also you can use when you connect your television operate from sofa :)- Robust build but bit cheap plastic compare to 2014 purchased model- If you want to use for office or home this one is perfect- The mouse is very handy medium size not too big or smallI'm rating this 8.5 out of 10
1,"Decided to return the product within few minutes of receiving it, for the following reasons.1. Both keyboard and mouse were very noisy..just can't bear the taka taka noise. Not only disturbs my concentration but I do a lot of Skype meetings in WFH mode and its extremely annoying for the paticipants on other side. 2. The pictures are bit deceptive, both mouse and keyboard are small. Keyboard width is ok, but the height is too small and I felt uncomfortable to use it. Prior to this I was using Dell KM 113, soft and no noise, working fine since Jan 2016, it has extra space at the bottom row of ky to rest hands comfortably, just that i needed extra USB slot for separate mouse, hence ordered this combo set.3. Mouse came defective ot of the box, light was not working.4. This feedback for Amazon seller, they sent me the item in a huge cartoon, which could easily fit a 32"" TV or 20-30 keyboard sets, see pic. Not sure what was the reason for such a huge cartoon, waste of resources and extra burden on ligistics."
2,Buy this wireless keyboard ONLY if you are just going to use it for basic use.NEVER for any sort of gaming. Keyboard and Mouse both lags on high CPU usage or game frame rates.there is no refund only useless replacement for this.I went back to my wired keyboard and mouse within one day. This is now packed back into the box...I will probably sell it for a loss on olx...
1,"After 4 months of infrequent use, the spring under some of the keys broke down. The product boasts of warranty of three years but it wont last even 6 months. The service centre at Gurgaon doesn't have the replacement ready. It takes nearly 10-15 days to get a new replacement. Till that time, sit tight and enjoy becuase you bought logitech product. Please avoid !!"
4,"I'm using this for 3 days only so its a quick review.Keyboard :Overall size is adequate for usage. Key sizes are a bit shorter than a regular wired keyboard of HP or Dell is what I felt bcos of which keys are going to next key than intended. Keys are noisy while typing, sounds like a less than 500 Rs unbranded keyboard which is not good for the brand.No comments on lag or range while typingMouse : I was using MK331 Silent mouse earlier, compared to that Smaller in size, and the feel is not good also click sounds are noisy. But this is not a silent mouse so accepted. I saw a bit of lag not sure whether this is bcos of something else.Overall this is budget pack.if you can extend a bit more go for MK345 combo, it claims quiet keyboard and the mouse looks like MK331 silent mouse but nowhere its is mentioned as M331 in the site."
3,"Review after 5 months of usageThe Good:The keyboard is good, strongly built, easily goes for years.It has all the keys you need, keys for volume control are really handy for me same with home, end button which are missing in my laptop.Works with Mac - Im able to use windows button as command key for (apple) mac, the Alt key as option key.It has caps lock indicator (light) which is helpful while typing the passwords.Not so good:However the keys bit hard especially when you are trying to type fast, you need to make sure that the keys are fully pressed down, otherwise some of the key may not be registered. The hard keys issue specifically happens when your finger touches the edge of the key - the key get kind of stuck between the adjacent keys. Its difficult to ensure that the fingers touch exactly in the middle of the key, its really annoying. This is happening more with windows key which Im using as command keyIf you want to really soft keyboard this may not be the option."
1,"Sometimes mouse and keyboard does not work, not expected from a company like Logitech"
5,"Even though this is not meant for Gaming, I have ended up using it. I thought we use a wireless PS4 controller so why not this. I also have a ReadGear Gaming Keyboard + Mouse combo and its started giving me issue in a year of gaming. I had to replace my ReadGear set with LG G102 Gamin Mouse and HP Gaming Keyboard K500F.This in comparison is working really well. All the Keys work fine, there are no misfires.. Its excellent. O have noticed some signal issues, for this I just make sure that the radio is connected on either side of the laptop (Not on one of the back USB Connectors)."
5,"Being a combo pack, don't expect a high quality product especially mouse.Keyboard build looks sturdy and when we type, we get some typing sound which is satisfying (this is subjective).Caps lock indicator works fine. On/off button works fine.Once I received product, I checked online if my keys are working fyn or not :D and everything is fine.Coming to Mouse, it appears with decent build quality(saying this because I have used lenovo 300(this is of solid build) earlier, on comparing logitech's mouse with Lenovo's, I observed it.).Battery, on/off button works fine. Mouse's precision is accurate and there's no lag.(even though if there's any lag, we can tweak the mouse settings).It was mentioned that battery life for keyboard is 36months and of mouse is 18months.When u turn it off while u r not using, expected battery life can be attained.Main reason I purchased this one is, I used Logitech K120 earlier, referring to its build quality, I got this one. And I needed 3 yrs warranty and good battery life with on/off buttons on both.Point to be noted : this is not a compact product. This one is a standard keyboard with all keys. So don't expect to carry it everywhere. If u need a compact one, u can go with portronics."
4,"I was actually pleasantly surprised how sturdy, robust and convenient this keyboard and mouse combo turned out to be.Pros:1. The keys are remarkably silent compared to many other keyboards2. The keys size and shape is sturdy and even the print is good which makes it super easy to operate3. Mouse is handy, small enough, big enough which makes it very friendly and reduces the chances of getting RSI4. Both keyboard and mouse have on/off toggle switches which is saving battery a lot and they last longer5. Indicator for CAPS lock comes handyCONS1. There are no indicators for Num Lock and Scroll Lock2. There is no indicator for battery levelOverallGreat value for money, if above indicators are added and keys are made slightly more silent, it will earn 5 stars on any day"
1,"After a firtnightly usage, with a sluggish and lagging Logitech MK270R keyboard and Mouse combo, I have thrown the KB and mouse into the dustbin. Such a badly designed product. It just literally slows down a 8 GB PC with ample storage space. Wireless connectivity to internet is getting slowed down. If I disconnect the KB and mouse from the computer, the net works normal and the mouse and keyboard  typing actions is taking ages to show up on the screen. I updated all the drivers including Logitech SPOT app. But to my dismay it has tested my patience prompting me to use the old PS/2 KB  and Moouse which are wired and work without any issues. Please don't buy this product."
5,"Great product from Logitech. Always recommend.High-quality product and is very durable, great precision.The mouse is Invisible Optic.I do both coding and gaming using this and surprisingly has a long battery life.Haven't changed the battery since purchase (before 4 months).Good for daily usage.Amazon delivery was great and arrived before the expected date."
1,"The product I got seems to be defective. The keys a wobbly, once you are typing, there is a lag.The product when I received was in a damaged package, when asked to the delivery, told he cannotdo anything about it. While typing the keys are getting missed.Not a product that I was expecting to be so cheap."
1,The keyboard and mouse stop and start functioning on a random basis.When actively typing the keyboard just freezes up or the unifying receiver stop responding and the keystrokes are completely lost.  This is a major issue when typing passwords. The same happens with the mouse pointer. The mouse pointer is jumpy or completely unresponsive and one ends up clicking unwanted things which becomes a waste of time. Contacting the logitech service center is also a complete waste of time. Think 2ice before buying it even though there might be offers on it.
1,"Within a month of use, the keys become loose and sometimes presses down on its own. With limited Service Centres (Ensure Services) and ""Great Than Thou"" attitude of Service Centre staff and Amazon ""apologetically refusing"" to do any help, I have decided to make it run as long as it dones and then buy a new one. Seems like few others buyers are facing the same issue. Anyway travelling to a service centre will cost as much as buying a new one."
1,"The mouse doesn't work and gets stuck.Even the scroll option doesn't work always.ADDING TO MY EARLIER REVIEW.......WORST PIECE OF GARBAGE EVER BOUGHT. i USED DELL COMBO BEFORE THIS, ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES FOR 6 YEARS STILL WORKS, JUST HAVE TO PRESS FEW KEYS HARDER ON THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE IS FLAWLESS. I CALLED AMAZON REP AND HE JUST PASSED THE BUCKET, AND TOLD ME GET IN TOUCH WITH SUPPLIER.  IF I HAD THIS MUCH FREE TIME WHY WOULD I BUY THE CRAP ONLINE. ITS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT, THE MOUSE WAS MALFUNCTIONING SINCE DAY ONE....THE CURSOR WOULD GET STUCK ANYTIME, SCROLLING MECHANISM IS A WASTE, DON'T WORK, KEYBOARD HAS ALSO STARTED ACTING UP....LOGITECH SUCKS...I DON'T KNOW WHY I WENT FOR THIS BRAND, NOT NOW NEVER WILL IT COME CLOSE TO DELL....CANT BELIEVE PEOPLE LIKE THOSE SPEAKERS THEY MAKE AS WELL....JUST GARBAGE BASS NO MIDS, HIGHS,....WONT BUY ANY LOGITECH STUFF EVER......."
3,"This keyboard is good for it's price, Nothing extraordinary, serves it purpose.Pros:1. 3 years warranty, one of the few keyboards with that kind of warranty.2. Has a Caps Lock Indicator (Higher range keyboards don't have a caps lock indicator)3. Keyboard Layout itself is good, Keys are appropriately placed.4. Media control keys5. Long Battery Life6. Single receiver for keyboard and mouseCons:1. The keyboard deck has quite a bit of flex to it, a bit more than my liking.2. The mouse is not comfortable to hold. I ended up keeping it aside and using my M331 separately which defeats the purpose of a combo3. No Numlock indicator, I guess this would have been done to save power from keeping the LED lit all the time.4. Keys are a little mushy, I would want a bit more clicky feel compared to other basic membrane keyboards.5. Non Unifying, Would have loved it to be unifying so I could use it with my M331 in a single receiver.I have a M331 mouse, which comes with a nano receiver (non unifying) and a M235 which comes with a unifying receiver, and this combo which again comes with a nano receiver, I tries all possible combinations but I could not get this keyboard and my M331 paired to a single receiver (I really don't like the feel of the M185 mouse that comes with this keyboard)."
3,"After I received a used product once, I requested for a replacement and seller shipped a sealed piece this time.Product Review:Pros: No lag in keyboard or mouse. Both will last long. Both are very light weight. Ease of going wireless is unbeatable. I was not using desktops since almost 10 years now. A full size keyboard with that typing noise is nostalgic atleast for me. Hope it doesn't cause disturbance to others on the call while I speak and type. On and off buttons on both keyboard and mouse. Caps lock light.Cons: for this price point the buttons have to be noiseless. Printing of letters on the keyboard buttons can be of better quality, they look bloated without smooth edges. Also the bumps on F and G are just thin lines, you can barely feel them. People who knew typing will understand this problem. Logitech could have given 2 latch height adjustment, there is only one which is just ok.Consider this as an entry level wireless keyboard and mouse combo. Since this is from Logitech, I hope it lasts long."
3,"Keyboard:I‚Äôve owned and used many, many keyboards‚Äîand I can confidently say the keys are harder to press than average; they have an uncomfortably soft feel. If a ‚Äúgood‚Äù keyboard is like tapping a steel spoon on a hard surface, this one is like pressing three fingers into a medium-hard pillow. Sound-wise, this might be good for some people though; the keys are relatively silent.There‚Äôs an extra, unnecessary line of multimedia keys at the top‚Äîas a result of which the Function keys are half the regular size. Plus, beware the dangerous ‚Äúsleep‚Äù or ‚Äúshut down‚Äù button: It put my computer into a weird hibernate mode. After waking from hibernate, two connected USB devices were getting disconnected and reconnected by themselves; I have *no idea* how that button managed this‚Äîit‚Äôs never happened on my laptop before! ...And there are a couple of keys that do nothing; I have no idea why Logitech thought it a good idea to bring back the multimedia keys that pretty much went out 10 years ago.There‚Äôs a keyboard on-off button at the top right. The battery lasts for more than a year; why would anyone want to turn the keyboard off?! AND as a result, there‚Äôs no space for the Num Lock indicator‚Äîonly the Caps Lock indicator.Mouse:It‚Äôs too small for the average adult male hand‚Äîand probably the ideal size for the average adult female hand. The tracking is spot on‚Äîon various surfaces and surface colours/darkness‚Äîand the buttons are decent (neither too hard to press nor too sensitive to the touch). No idea about gaming.Range:As you‚Äôd expect from Logitech. You can use the keyboard and mouse from anywhere in the room, pretty much.Overall, this is mid-low quality, BUT good value for money. To summarise: Spend just maybe 1,000 more and get something better. Buy this one if you‚Äôre really on a tight budget‚ÄîAND you have woman-sized hands."
1,I have has very bad experience with the warranty section of Logitech. I talked to the number given. First you to have to keep on trying. Secondly it when you reach them and explain to them the problem faced by you then they refer you to another number which they call it as Service Centre. If that is what they wanted to do then  why not give the Service Centre number then the other number. They just do not want to avoid servicing under warranty. I have been regularly been their customer for last more than 10 years. I am facing teh same prob lem of right c lic k being not working after ab t 8 to 9 months. This I faced it earlier but did not take it up. I am very diappointed.
2,"KEYBOARDPros----1. Metal top and thick plastic base makes it very strong and minimum deck flex.2. Raised keycaps and tactile membrane keys. IT'S NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD.3. Long braided cable with strong USB connector.4. Decent rubber pads to stop slipping on the desk.5. Windows lock and RGB light brightness control buttons.6. Interchangeable WASD and Arrow Keys.Cons----1. Input gets stuck sometimes even if the keys are not stuck. Happens about 4 times in 24 hours on average.2. Sometimes input is not registered.3. Keys are not equally tactile. Space bar takes a lot of effort.4. Only 3 light colour combination, no effects. Forget about software synchronisation.5. It's NOT TRULY BACKLIT, key labels are not visible by the light, only the key gaps are lit.6. Packaging is bad.MOUSEPros----1. Ergonomic and grippy design, easy to hold for medium and large hands.2. Metal base allows smooth movement and weight to the mouse.3. 6 buttons - Left/Right/Scroll/DPI/Forward/Backward4. 4 DPI settings 1000/1600/2400/3200 through cycling.5. Long braided cable with stroNg USB connector.Cons----1. Sometimes input is not registered.2. Metal base is not removable if you prefer light mouse.3. Only RGB breathing effect, nothing else.4. Forget about any other features at this price with RGB.I bought this about a month ago and it's running good. The build quality is very strong, you can kill a person with the keyboard. The packaging is very bad, resulting in a lot of people getting damaged products.Even though there's issues with inputs for both the mouse and keyboard, it never happened during my daily 4 hour gaming binge. However, I don't recommend this for intense FPS gaming as it can be difficult to hold the mouse for very fast movements for a long time.The RGB is okay but the money could have been used for adding other features or making the existing ones better, or at least they could've made the key-labels visible by the light. I do not recommend buying this at Rs.1600 as there are other better alternatives available at that price or a little more, like the Cooler Master keyboard-mouse combo. Buy this if you get a sale where the price is closer to Rs.1000.Edit: As of 02/02/2020, the '1' and 'Z' keys from the alpha-numeric set have stopped working. I have reduced the ratings as the problems mentioned above have increased and new problem has come up. The mouse works fine, but if clicked too hard, next click won't register. I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying at more than half the price, save more money and buy other better options."
5,"Okay, so I got this combo today. The packaging was a bit bad. The box was deformed at some point, but the keyboard and mouse were in excellent condition.Talking about the product, the build quality is awesome. The breathing LEDs are a charm. The mouse is way too smooth. The keyboard keys don't wobble and give somewhat a mechanical feel.In short, the headline is 100% right. Just go for it !"
5,"I was a bit skeptic at first when this was on offer for 1200rs, as i don't usually trust reviews here. but must say this one blew my expectations and i have a new found respect for reviewers too.The quality of the keyboard and the mouse is very good better than good i must say.The LED features could have been more elaborate well any ways u can turn them off on both the devices.(On the mouse long press the Dpi button to turn off the LED). ps-found it the hard way.STURDY, BEAUTIFUL AND VALUE FOR UR EVERY PENNY."
4,"This really a worth deal for 1150 which I got this pair of keyboard and mouse for . So now first of all I received this package 1 day after the estimated day the packaging was really bad and was making some noises then I found that there were two screws which were unscrewed in the process of shipping or something . The ergonomics of mouse is really good it just fits perfectly in my hands the buttons on the mouse pretty good but two side buttons are really clumsy to click I have accidentally the button I don't want to click like 1/5 times the keyboard also doesn't have that clicky feeling it has a soft feeling the wires are really good they are braided and have gold plating on the male usb end ....overall a good deal but don't get your hopes so high ,the quality is good for the price you are paying you don't get to customise the RGB of individual key but you can try few zone lighting or u can turn the lights off but you cannot turn off the mouse lights"
2,"While using in a room full of light this keyboard is value for money;However when you use it in a dark room, you cannot see what you are typing unless you are pretty used to typing without seeing.The keys are not backlit, the RGB lights are there but you still cannot see anything on the keyboard in a dark room."
4,The product is very good ..... Elite keyboard under fair price .....But the MRP isn't 2599... But it is 1599 (as shown behind the box).
5,Amazing build qualityAluminum build qualitySwitches are tactile and nice and solid feelMouse dpi is amazing very fast response rate for games like csgo and fortnite
5,"If your in a budget, you will really appreciate this combo.. This is one of the best that you can get.. If you can find it around or less than 1200, buy it in local shop. Bcuz, amazon ships this product is an extremely bad shape. Ive bought 3 of these in the past 2 to 3 years. 1 from local which was good. And 2 from amazon which was damaged a bit. Since there was a local service center I was able to get it replaced. If u dnt get a damaged one, then you'll definitely love this. Some pros and cons after using for 2 years.Pros:Stylish metallic lookKeys and mouse buttons are really durableAlthough it's membrane, key press is really smooth and silent.Mouse bottons are smooth and thumb buttons are easy to reach and would be grt while gaming.Sensors are very decent and will be perfectly fine unless you are a professional gamer.Keyboard has 3 adjustable height.If you feel the mouse to be heavy, you can remove the side and bottom plates but it'll void warranty.Cons:Scroll wheel will definitely fail at one point but this was not an issue for me as this can be fixed easily. Checkout YouTube for this.The rgb lights are pointless. Lights are behind the keys and keys doesn't allow light through them so you can't see the keys in a dark room.The package always arrives in a damaged state. So you gotta be lucky to get an undamaged piece.There's no software so mouse will always have a breathing light effect and keyboard has 2 to 3 modes which can't be modified. But this can't be considered a con for a product at this price and I always keep the lights off.Apart from these minor cons, the functionality and performance of this product is outstanding."
1,Ofcourse it looks well lit but the performance is poor. I got this product and after 2 weeks the scroll key in mouse started malfunctioning. After a month the keyboard started malfunctioning. If you consider budget wise you can buy this... But if you want to use it for a prolonged period of time then this product is not suited for you. Just after a month buying this product now I'm gonna have to buy a new keyboard and mouse.Not Satisfied with this product!
3,"I was wondering that it will be good thing to work during dark or night without disturbing others but it doesn't show up the keys, during dark and make difficult to identify the keys, lights glow below the keys and keys not made transparent so that it also glow. I later purchased other keyboard to solve my issue, I didn't return this because my son liked it due to changing light patterns and he use the desktop to play games or drawing."
1,Got in two days after ordering.. packaging was worst ever.. keyboard was damaged from outside.. slight 4 bends on body and a lot of scratches on back.. came in wet condition.. didn‚Äôt applied for replacement because it was working fine and also think that i was waste of time as it takes week to exchange.. be carefull although the product is goof..Edit: after giving one star.. it stops taking image in review..
5,"I have recently purchased it and I am very satisfied with it, because its key spacing is nice and keys are also good and no noise problem is there. I will surely recommend you this product. Colours brightness level is also good and all combination of colours are also nice. In short it is the best product in this range."
1,"Pathetic product, it's just a fancy product who want there keyboard to glow. No functionality what so ever for those RGB. Keys are not backlit. Also when light is low and you turn on the RGB lights of keyboard . Visibility of keys further decreases because of the lights coming from keyboard. Better avoid such product and go for its higher priced model or chose keyboard of some other brand. There are many keyboard at this price far better then this like circle and nighthawk. Don't buy this crap."
5,Blue logo light to bright
5,"It is a strong, sturdy, beautiful keyboard. Go through the manual after purchase.Edit: Mouse has a loose contact problem. At first I thought it was my laptop problem. But actually I bought the laptop after buying this. Laptop is fine. So, I'm concluding that it's the mouse problem. Still, it works fine in other slots. And that one problematic slot has no issues with any other devices too.. Also, WASD key's text has started fading by now. I don't think the paint will last long. Anyway, it's a good buy."
5,Best gaming keyboard
5,"Whatever expectations i had with this keyboard and mouse are fulfilled and i really like it. I ordered this for gaming and typing because i am a blogger, so i need to type a lot and till now its working perfectly fine. But the only issue i saw was that the backspace key was wobbling a little bit when it arrived, and after the use obviously it will increase but that is just normal and will happen with any keyboard whose key travel is high, but surprisingly wobbling doesn't makes any noise. The sound when i type is not mechanical sound but still gives a mechanical keyboard feel. RGB colours of the mouse are very cool and are kind of very unique colours which you don't see very often in daily life and RGB of keyboard is not extraordinary, infact i would say that if RGB of keyboard is turned off then it looks more nice because the colour combination of black keys aluminum's colour makes it a very decent and classy looking keyboard. Build quality of keyboard and mouse is very nice and i accidentally drooped keyboard from about a height of 5 feet and it had no damage at all. I also had a doubt that the print on the keycaps would fade after use and since in gaming W,S,A,D keys are used the most, so i thought that those key's print would fade but it didn't not happen and they are as clear as if its new. The price this product offers is also decent and product is awesome. So much recommended"
5,I loved it
5,Keyboard d is responsive and comfortable. The stands gives a comfortable angle to type. Mouse is good for all kinds of hands and feels responsive. The cables are braided and strong.These are the best periferals for 1000 RS . It is perfect for gaming and extremely durable.
5,Damm It's Just Amazing.The quality Of the Product is Great in That price.Pro's ->Metal BoddyMechanical feelPremium LooksRGB / 4-5 ModsMouse feels Solid & HaveyWires Are Fully BridgetGold Plated USB2 Mod StandsMouse Works Very Good Even in Gaming time2 Extra Function key on MouseCons->Keys Not RemovableI would say For 1300/INRThis is What You should buyJust Buy it With Out wasting Any timeIt's better then even 2500/inr keyboards
1,"A super cheap keyboard mouse combo.Mouse:Pros:1. Main buttons are good. Tactile feel is okayish.2. Pretty responsive mouse.Cons:1. Light as a feather. Needs to have some weight, some minimum weight.2. Airy Side buttons though they work have no feel. People who experienced these kind of buttons can tell, they don't last more than a few days and also you can't physically feel any click, absolutely zero tactile feel except for a very faint click sound. So these are not really useful in gaming. You don't normally see these buttons anywhere, I saw these only once before on a very cheap Chinese made FM radio set as a on/off button.3. Metal back plate will scratch your table.Mouse Rating: 3/5 for this price.Keyboard:Pros:Feel is somewhat mechanical.Cons:1. Very elevated: The metal plate lies flat on table and keys are very elevated. It's insanely difficult to type keeping your wrist straight. While gaming there is zero wrist support. Wrist starts to pain in a few minutes. Carpel tunnel is guaranteed. See pics attached.2. The keyboard came very dusty and seems like used, see close up images attached.3. The RGB is only RGB not key backlight. What do I mean, light comes from the gaps but not from the letters on the keyboard. Meaning you cannot see illuminated ABC etc, only light from all around the keys but actual keys don't glow. See pics attached.4. There is no shread of ergonomics in the keyboard.Keyboard Rating: 0/5Okay mouse. Keyboard only good to hang as an RGB decoration."
5,"I purchased this for 1100. Yeah was a steal at the price! Coming to the product, the build quality is top notch and this certainly doesn't feels like a super budget set. Just hold it on your hands and you'll know what I'm trying to say. Aluminium used and it looks so freaking good!The mouse does the job well too and the extra buttons can be easily maped. I use this in competitive FPS like Apex Legends, CS GO, PUBG etc and this comes in real handy. However note it'll take time for you to get used to it. It's a bit heavy to use but once you're used to it, there's no issue.A few things I didn't like were that LEDs weren't lit in the keys but just the gaps. I mean it still looks great but if you wanna use it in the dark, you wouldn't be able to see. Also the space bar takes a lil effort. The mouse is perfect and there's nothing to crib about there.However the packaging was just ""BAD"". Please look after it AMAZON.  I don't know why they did it but I just got the keyboard box without any wrapping or protection. ( It was a bit damaged from the the sideS too, Thank God the components were safe xD ).Nonetheless, it's a steal for 1100 or even 1200-1300. Full 5 stars from my side considering the price."
5,THIS IS THE BEST KEYBOARD AND MOUSE I HAVE EVER SEEN PLAESE GO FOR IT AS IT IS THE BEST YOU CAN HAVE IN SO MUCH LESS PRICE IF IT WERE OF EVEN 5000 RUPEES THEN TOO I WONT BE SHOCKEDP.S - YOU DONT GET TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL KEYBOARD AND MOUSE QUALITY EVEN IN THE PHOTOS GIVEN BY AMAZON  OR ON THE REVIEWS IN THE YOUTUBE. WHEN YOU GET THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD THEN YOU GET TO KNOW THAT THE QUALITY IS TOP NOTCH PLEASE CONSIDER TO BUY
5,"The mouse some times doesn't connect for 1 sec but is fine later (happens rarely but it does) isn't a big problem. Also, the mouse is really good cause my last mouse scratched my laptop's surface and the second I put it on my laptop it slid so smoothly. I recommend you buy this for a Laptop or a PC. The cable is long enough so that if my laptop is connected with HDMI to my TV I could still put my back by the bed and play normally(really helpful).The Keyboard has good lights too and is comfortable even when put on laps. It took some days but I got used to typing on this keyboard (as am a fast typer that was awfully quick for me. though it could have been better though that would increase the price a lot."
5,"My kid specifically asked for this for gaming after seeing it at his friends' place. But given more school work/studies going online, it is a good full size keyboard for kid to minimize wrist fatigue. It is really good and in kid's words -- ""satisfying"" especially from mechanical type of feeling. Mouse is very cool too.  The smile on kid's face makes is a must buy for parents. Moreover it is an Indian brand so very proud of it too. It looks futuristic too from ""transformers theme"" styling perspective and subtle LED lighting. Quick delivery by Amazon despite lockdown etc. Big thank you and hi-five to Amazon and Zebronics."
5,"I previously had a HP GK320, which was trash. Really speaking this is far more better. Everything is fantastic, especially the wrist rest and the volume nob. You can control its brightness, rgb movement speed and above all you can install red gear's own software to control the rgb lighting. Although it does not have per key rgb feature. Blue keys will remain blue and green will remain green. Still for the price I got (i.e. 2349), its really a great budget gaming mechanical keyboard. With fantastic key clicks."
4,"It's a mechanical one, obviously makes noise. I believe this is better than the normal membrane one. It's comes with user manual, key removal kit, wrist support and heavy weight champion. Actually it is bit heavy(1.3kg)üòÖ. From my knowledge it *does have special software to adjust or control led spectrum it is true these mk853 are rebranded from fantech which is the real manufacturer you can get keyboard software from their official site . It come with inbuilt 22mode spectrum. And this one nailed its competitors *note in this price range. Overall built quality is a cheek kiss. it has better life than normal membrane one. Nandri vanakam"
1,"The packaging was extremely fragile and it was clearly visible that it had been opened before it was delivered to me. I used it for two days and on the second day some of the keys started acting weirdly, the down arrow key and the right side arrow key both were performing the same function so the keys were of no use. The W key also stopped working on the same day. Extremely dissappointed with the purchase. The keyboard itself is good but the product which I received was terrible. I hope Amazon will do something about it."
1,After using this keyboard for 4 and half months of usage this is the 1st and worst ever keyboard to go for Gaming or typing keys itself kept coming off on slight touch and malfunctioning also you need to press some keys very hard because they become very less reponsive save your money and go with cosmic byte or logitech and dont get blinded by useless video reviews they dont use it for months or years its just an eye candy
1,"i returned my product cause my d-key was not working properly, but they never returned it back to me. worst  customer care ,they always say they are having network issue .i contacted them again after a while and they are saying same thing. dont buy redgear"
4,"My primary use is typing for ~10 hours and gaming afterward.While typing, it feels almost as smooth and crispy as those classic TVS Gold Keyboards. Also, it feels as if it is typing itself XD Blue switches are awesome in this budget (I got it for 2500).The only issue I have is with the number row on top. Could've used slightly bigger fonts as looking at the numbers, it feels as if they were only slightly printed. Since the palm rest is plasticy, your palm would start to sweat soon and leave smudges. Be sure to clean it regularly.Otherwise, this keyboard is worth it, I feel.P. S. Writing my first Amazon Review as I was enjoying typing so much in this keyboard."
5,Video Player is loading.
4,As usual quality of the logitech keyboard is awesome. But the keyboard is having begnali alphabets printed along with english. For me its not at all needed and making some discomfort. Never mentioned this fact in the product description. Otherwise I will give it 5 stars.
4,"First of all, I bought this keyboard for home use because i use the same keyboard in my office, and this keyboard is really nice for this price.But the issue is, seller sent me a keyboard with Bengali letters printed on the keys (see the pictures) which looks very cluttered, which i didn't want, so be aware of that and ask the seller which keyboard they have.One more thing,May be i am wrong,  but i noticed that key stroke of this keyboard is little bit less quality of the one which i use at office."
3,"Not even 2 months yet and facing issue with keys.. letter f behaves erratically , sometimes not responding on key-press and sometimes keeps on typing (sending command for) f continuously automatically by itself.In short : either i received a duplicate product or a faulty product.[Update] : on complaining to Logitech, keyboard was replaced in warranty by them free of cost. Replaced one is working fine."
5,"It is very comfortable ,keys are good n if you want to learn typing it very nice n comfortable to learn typing...no problem for dat n the design is nice,cable lenght also no problem it's long enough ... supporting for windows 7 which am using ,em reviewing after 3-4 months of use no problem of connectivity,no loose connection problem of the cable... everything is fine guys ,finally one thing for learning typing better to take dis one it's comfortable n won't feel to come back when you start typing by using typing master....this msg is according to my opinion hope may be useful for anyone tq u"
2,Two stars overall for poor quality controlPros :1) This keyboard stays firm unlike the older keyboards which is a good thing. Soft key typing2) Design wise The Escape key is in a weird position compare to my older  K200 keyboard which takes a while to get use to. Not a major problemCons: Failed in 6 months. + key is not working and sometimes works automatically. Bad quality control. Keys are a bit wobbly. Swiss quality?
4,"If u are reading this review, if u thinking to buy keyboard for daily use, offical or Non gaming. So please ga ahead and buy it, before you are going that rabbit hole to buy that expensive keyboard.  This works boss, no fuss. I got this along with wireless mouse to attach to my laptop to work from home. Simple living. Keyboard is very good. Does not get struck or make liund noise. I want to thank a amazon review from Australia. He helped me understand that all I needed was this keyboard. Thanks for reading till here. And I hope you must me tired if u are like me. Go ahead and order this and sleep peacefully. Cheers."
5,Logitech is a premium and trustworthy brand so don't give a 2nd thought and go for it.It is a full size keyboard with elevated and smooth buttons.It can be used for gaming too because keys are like mechanical keyboard.Wire length is well enough.Quality is best.It has No backlit so can be a problem if you are typing in dark.Hit helpful !
4,"I purchased this keyboard as a temporary replacement for my gaming keyboard, the Microsoft Sidewinder X6, which after serving me well for 4 years, is nearing the end of its life. This keyboard is a very basic one with no bells and whistles. For its price, it offers a very good build quality, standard key layover, and a seperate numeric keypad. There are no media control or internet-related controls, nor or are there any USB ports. It connects to the computer via a USB 2.0 port, but you can also use a USB 3.0 port. This is a good value-for-money product, which, for occasional users, should be a good performer. I am a heavy gamer, and with my usage pattern, this keyboard will not last more than 2 years. By that time, I am hoping to have saved enough to be able to purchase a mechanical gaming keyboard. The only negatives in the keyboard are:1. Its keys have sharp edges. Having rounded edges would've delivered a better typing experience.2. Typing fast results in a minor lag between pressing of a key and the related result appearing on the screen. I guess it is to be expected in low-end hardware.VERDICT: Good value-for-money product, but only for occasional typists and price-conscious consumers."
1,The product description says it is spill resistant but it actually  it is not. i spilled coffee on it and it was at room temperature . i let t drain over night but it stopped  working one key by one next morning. also it is not smooth to type ever
5,"Good quality keyboard, feels comfortable to type on. The Enter key is ANSI layout, that is, it is placed below the backslash ('\') instead of backspace like in most keyboards which follow the ISO layout. It is also smaller and occupies less space which might end up being problematic.Other than that, it's probably the best keyboard in its price range (unless you prefer laptop-style keycaps). The keycap markings haven't been a least bit damaged and all the regularly used keys still function like new.Delivery was very good with a properly packaged package. No damages whatsoever."
5,"I bought this in 2017 December for Rs. 595, and today is 2020 November. Literally 3 whole years and this keyboard is still working absolutely fine with no issue!I'm an everyday PC user, on average about 4 hours daily is must for me. Yet not even a single key has stopped working.Don't hesitate if you're getting this anywhere around Rs. 595 because you won't regret!"
3,"I bought this 6 months ago and the 'C' button sometime doesn't register. It's slowly getting worse and I think within the next 2 months the key will fail.Yes, I do use the 'ctrl+c' and 'v' a lot.Also this keyboard has no media keys or an Fn key. You'll come to understand they're needed once you use one with those leys."
5,"Earlier I was using a Dell KB212-B which had to replaced after many years of use. Unfortunately that product was discontinued. The Logitech K120 is almost an exact replication of the Dell KB212-B - but minus the key noise. So, my fingers don't have to relearn key position. Also, the Dell KB212-B keys are bit softer to the touch. At almost Rs 800/- the Logitech K120 keyboard is more expensive to be sure but I feel the keyboard build and quality is worth the price. Note: This is not for gaming."
5,"Unlike people complaining about getting letters of other languages printed on their keyboards, mine has got purely English characters only. Overall the keyboard is working perfectly, the keys are pretty much steady. It's a charm to work on this keyboard. See, I'm a programmer and I work on it a bit much and it gets used a lot everyday, still it holds up very good. I don't know about extensive gaming perspectives but it's very much suited for coding and can be a very good companion for programmers"
5,I'm using phone 9 hours a day and I can peacefully tell you blindly by this keyboard and you will just love it.Please note Logitech is the OEM supplier four major brands like HP Dell extra so even if you buy a HP keyboard it is going to be manufactured by Logitech and name is printed as HP.ProsLightweight keyboardUSB connectorKeystroke is not too long or too shortOverall plastic quality seems goodProper full-size keyboard from a branded companyConsThere is no inbuilt form support that is the only drawback
5,"It was purchased by me on 12 Nov 2016 and it started giving problems around 15th October 2021I googled lifespan of Logitech Keyboards and it said 5-10 years so, it almost worked for 5 years for me (my keys weren't damaged or anything everything comes to how you use sometimes ; I didn't clean it much often and maybe dust & debris has made my keyboard act weird like randomly freezing or spamming a particular letter and not work or even on hard pressing the keys would just not accept my inputs)Overall I'm satisfied with the product I recieved on purchaseThank You Logitech Now I'm just sad and on the hunt of finding my next suitable keyboard that is cheap and long lasting !"
5,"I purchased this keyboard mainly for gaming. Though it is made of plastic the quality is very good at this price. I was going to by a Rs. 1200 gaming keyboard, but somewhere in my mind I was hesitating to do that. As at that price you don't get mechanical keyboard. But then thought to buy this simple keyboard as the review was very great. And I am glad that I bought this.By the way this keyboard works great for gaming."
3,"Initially I received a defective piece, the CTRL & RETURN key was not working properly.I request for a replacement which was done promptly.The replacement Item worked well for first 52 days. On the 53rd day suddenly it started giving issuesThe keys at the bottom are not working. Return window is already gone.Looking for getting it replaced from service centre. Any help is appreciated"
5,"The keyboard is really good, the keys are really easy to type in. Overall the experience is very good, and there is a smoothness of the use of the keyboard. I am so happy with this, product. Typing was never my kind of thing, but this has reaffirmed my love for typing back again. Thanks to Logitech, for this wonderful ergonomic product and thanks to AMAZON India for delivering this in a less amount of time. My suggestion is to introduce this keyboard in Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, etc, and other Indian vernacular languages."
1,"Back to Logitech after using other junk brands for some time.Edit : After 2 years, many buttons stopped working. Opened it up to see the circuit traces almost missing in many places. Seems like the traces just vanish after a while, rendering many keys useless. Very poor reliability."
2,"After reading lot of reviews and and doing good amount of research i bought this keyboad, as many were suggesting this is the best budget keyboard. But it did disappoint me for the below reasons:1. Too noisy  If you are someone who prefer the click sound for every keypress then its not a problem for you. I prefer working in silent environment and the keypress sounds were very distracting for me while writing the code / thinking.2. Long key travel  For laptop users who are used to short key travel, this is big NO as the touch and feel of the keyboard is fully different and you may not like it.3. Feel of the keyboard  For the price we paid we cannot expect a premium keyboard but this one feels very cheap and rough while typing on it, not even worth 500Rs.Pros:1. If you like the traditional keyboard / mechanical keyboard with long keytravel and big keys and want to have them covered in your budget then this keyboard is for you.2. Easy to identify the keys as the print on them is big and bold and clean.As i have been using laptop keyboard for last 4 years, i found Dell kb216 keyboard a much better option as a secondary keyboard than the logitech one."
3,"This is not a great keyboard by any standards. But for a lil more than 500 you really can't ask for much. It's quite flimsy. When I got it first, the num-lock and scroll-lock keys weren't working. I got it exchanged. On the exchanged one I figured scroll-lock is not working. I didn't bother exchanging it again cuz other than when I use MS Excel, I wouldn't need to use scroll-lock much."
5,"I bought this keyboard to use during my summer internship as a programmer. For the next 3 months, the keyboard went through all sorts of stress-tests and boy did it come out victoriously! The keyboard exceeded my expectations in almost all areas. The keys are big, the presses are deep, the ergonomics are great and the sound of the keys is soft yet affirming. Logitech deserves several accolades for making even their cheapest keyboard a delight to use."
4,"Soft keys, with some noise, if someone sleeping in the room definitely you don't want to have this keyboard, especially the space key with some metal clinging sound. I use it for everyday work, so having soft keys are preferred over noise they produce. There is a noticeable flux in the middle due to the soft plastic body, its not a big deal anyway. Overall the keyboard looks nice, and have no sharp keys, the price can be tad lower, like 500 range."
1,This is possibly the worst item that I've ever purchased on amazon. The keys hardened so much in a month even with little to no use because of my university exams that it's impossible to type now. I didn't expect this from amazon.
5,"This is good for normal typing, in fact I used it for a few weeks before I decided to buy a mechanical keyboard. I had once typed 20000 words in a day using this keyboard, and it didn't give me any problem.It is suitable for normal use, the keyboard feels good - if you type 5k words a day or less, then it is a good choice, but for heavy duty use, consider using a cherry mx blue switch keyboard. For its price range, it is the best value for the money."
1,"after using it for few hours, randomly some keys doesn't work properly. When pressed once, it types 8 to 10 times and sometimes doesn't type even once. Had to return it."
5,"I earlier used a Dell keyboard which had keys for multimedia. It became error prone (keys would stick or not press properly) after 2.5 years. So I chose logitech which is a leader in this. Though the delivery was much delayed, the product itself has been pretty good so far. I have only used for 10 days but I am able to get proper tactile feedback and it is helps faster typing."
5,It makes some noise while typing but I like it. The buttons are good and perfect ni size. There are enough buttons and shortcuts.I will edit this with warranty customer service details if I ever need one.
5,"Some of the keys of my laptop keyboard wasn't functioning. Although Windows provides Onscreen keyboard with mouse operated clicking facility, I purchased this much less costly traditional keyboard with USB connector,  instead of going for a costly laptop mount keyboard replacement. It's working nicely."
4,"Been using Logitech peripherals for over a decade, but when my old keyboard gave up, decided to be a cheapskate and ordered a random keyboard off Amazon. Keyboard gave up within 2 weeks, learned my lesson and came to Logitech. Wisest decision I've made!Been using this keyboard everyday for 7 months and have no complains. For me, SPACEBAR is the first key to break, once it starts wobbling, I know the days of the keyboard are numbered. But the Logitech K120 keys are still as firm as they were when I got them. All keys are uniform and have a nice heft to them. Gives a lot of confidence while typing. Would definitely recommend.Purchased for Rs. 795Would purchase again"
2,"Product description  and its invoice (still available on record) very clearly includes digital wired Mouse along with keyboard but the Mouse was not delivered. Keyboard was delivered and works fine.  Supposed to be Combo offer but wonder why Mouse was missed. At this price, without Mouse, the keyboard is too expensive and misrepresents value. Why hoodwink customers ? One can easily buy this keyboard for Rs500-600 at a local shop and also support them."
5,"This ergonomically designed full size keyboard is perfect for my heavy duty typing needs.The product more than meets expectations as it comes with a good quality wired logitech mouse.Much better than my Amkette mouse bought from Nehru Place.The lead cables with the keyboard as well as the mouse are adequate in length.Only con, not for me though, is that some users may find it noisy.I bought it despite not so rave reviews and am pretty satisfied with Logitech quality.I can now confidently buy Logitech K400 keyboard for my Ipad."
3,"Keyboard is not bad and though it is little noisy while typing, it is comfortable and able to type fast. However one problem I have noticed which is, when u hold the shift key on both side (left and right shift) and type the underscore key or few other symbols on the number (example - closing bracket on the 0 key) is not working. when you release one of the shift key it is working fine. I am not sure its the issue only with my keyboard. If it is general then Logitech has to look into this. I have never seen this issue on lenovo or Dell keyboard.Example: I wanted to type ORACLE_SID. for typing the first caps word ORACLE  I have to hold the shift key and I generally hold the left shift key. For the underscore, I always use right shift key with the underscore key which is near to 0. while typing underscore, right shift key I am not releasing as I have the second word which is SID in caps to be typed after the underscore. But in this keyboard I always miss underscore as I am holding both the shift keys."
5,"This is an amazing product at this price range. Got a keyboard & mouse combo for 599 and am totally surprised at the quality and feel. Is in no way less than a Dell or HP (I have used  them all) and the price is simply unbelievable. I have 4 keyboards (1 iBall, 2 HP, 1 Dell ) and none of them can beat this. The mouse works great too. If you are looking to buy a keyboard mouse combo, look no further."
5,"Keyboard is great. Nice for daily usage and typing work. 3 years warranty is awesome. It's spill proof, membrane keyboard.It is even better than those membrane keyboards with RGB and price tag of ‚âà 1000 Rs.It is better than any keyboard in range upto 1000.Choose this keyboard if you are looking for budget keyboard.If you want better than this, go for mechanical not less.Final words. Don't lose gold for glitter."
4,"Nothing fancy about it. Basic wired keyboard. Keys have a little bit resistance I feel but nothing to make you uncomfortable. Item was delivered in the original logitech package without any Amazon packaging. Little less plastic for the environment you can argue. It's got the 3 indicator lights for Scroll, Numlock and Caps lock. The only drawback I see is the tilt at the back which gives you just 1 position a little less for me"
5,"The keyboard delivered was as per desription mentioned.I wanted the standard keyboard (With out multimedia and other keys)  for work from home and looking for  same keyboard as in office and it served the purpose.Recommend Logitech over other cheaper products even though price  is slightly on higher note, one can easily feel the diffrence in smoothness of key stroke."
3,"This is a first day review.Working fine.Cable length is short as compare to my earlier Dell keyboard and its very thin also.worst thing is, There is no packaging on keyboard when arrived, only minor bubble rapping, bt still no breakage.price is high i think bcz of branding i think. frm my point of view it should b in between 400 to 500rs."
5,its a semi mechanical keyboard and i can see the major difference between my old normal keyboard and this keyboard it feels so satisfying while typing on it it has RBG lights in it you can turn these lights on or off as required by just a click on scroll lock button its body shape is a little bit curvy which don't let it slip on the table surface and sticks it on a fixed position
5,unbelievable !  I get such a nice gaming keyboard at this price range. I am very happy with the performance of keyboard . lightning is also good . texture of keys make the keyboard very comfortable to use . price is very good for this types of keyboard overall I like this product very much and don't get confuse go for it .
3,"It's got light under some of the keys that shines through the key letter but the colours are not balanced and not all keys glow in same brightness.Keys with red light are dull compared to other keys. Number keys on top row and keys on left like q,w,e,r,t,a,s,d,f,h,z,x,c,v are very dull.If you're used to typing on laptop keyboardsnthis will be a bit hard to use, the keys need to be pressed all the way in. During fast typing you'll realise some of the key press are not recognised. Will take some time to get adjusted."
5,Best keyboard go blindly for it at this price point .. lightweight ..good quality plastic not that cheap one ... brightness could be better but for the price it's best ...key sound is amazing and space bar is mechanical ..other keys are membrane but elevated ones so that good thing ... everything works totally fine
5,Nice quality keyboard for my laptop and wire length is good. Good support given in keyboard and light is very beautiful at night. Keyboard are working like mechanical keyboard means all Quality and features are really appreciable Thanks Amazon
5,It is easy to use and the lights are attractive.. prefect for gaming as well as everyday use.... Thanks to amazon for Fast Delivery and packaging also goodüòä
5,"When I use much time on pc with palying games, With this keyboard no pain to my wrist and very smooth and soft to click the keyboard buttons. Backlit lights are fantastic. Quality is also good."
5,Build quality of keyboard is Good and working is excellent. All lights glow clearly and useful and make flash in night vision colour of lights is make me more attractive to my work is really great things.All keys are removable and fit easily.
5,The keyboard quality is great at this budget point. The lightning features is also good. raised key gives us mechanical  keyboard like feeling . Build quality is also great at this price. all the keys space is also very much good . Overall good experience with this purchase
3,Build quality is quite plastic and does not feel sturdy. Buttons had to be pressed a bit hard to take effect.There are other options available under 1K with aluminium build quality (MK 01).
5,Keys are semi mechanical and the rgb lights are in good brightness.Perfect for both gaming and office use.Good quality keyboard at this price range.I just loved it
5,"Love The Keyboard So Much, Amazing Feel While Using the keyboard as it is semi mechanical . Lights Are Pretty Bright So you can work in dark also. Looks Sturdy if used right. And Full Size Keyboard ."
2,"Keyboard quality is very bad and light is too low, mouse is good. Not a value for money, try any other company mouse keyboard."
5,Its Rgb light looks so good.While playing games in the night i can clearly see every key cap in the dark. while typing its feels like we are cliking on a mechanical keyboard. Its plastic quality is also good.
5,Best keyboard in this budget... There are more expensive keyboard than this keyboard.. But this one is a lot better than them... Key pressing feedback is awesome .Default lighting effect... Build quality is also very good and strong..
2,The wire and the keyboard is made of low quality and the keyboard plastic is low quality and the keys are not that great will not able to hold properly when gaming and mouse is great no issues with it but it's not great but like normal keyboard
1,"Received a defective product. for 1 hour it works normaly after that keyboard stop working, each time you have to unplug the keyboard and plug in to use. Quality is not good. If you are looking for along life keyboard don't buy this one."
5,Amazing product so much happy to having this in this price segment.  Looks very cool and lighting is very good
5,Best keyboard in this range feels premium and the RGB light makes it a perfect Gaming Keyboard. Highly recommended.
1,"As i just buy this keyboard for RGB Backlight which is not brighter , and i found a scratch in keyboard on delivery . As Packing of Amazon is very good . RGB Backlight is the thing that disappoint me the most"
5,Keystrokes are superb. Brightness of lights is good and eye catchy. Key to key distance is optimal. Quality of keyboard is good and this is a worth it product at this price segment.
5,"Working well...great keyboard, loved it totally satisfied ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçSuper product and amount discount üëå"
5,the lights are soft so it doesn't dizzy the eyes and doesn't makes eyes get dried whereas keys are soft which gives aided advantage for better and fast typing
3,Very less birghtness and keybord quality less
5,product is good keys are upto mark work vary well
5,"Excellent product, very useful and innovative. I loved it very much. Great battery life, good for gaming and typing. RGB lighting makes it quite exciting. It's like a remote of your PC, Laptop, Tablet, Mobile ir android tv/set top box, definitely can go for it. It's a complete replacement for keyboard plus mouse, great innovation. Salute for innovator."
5,The product is really amazing .First received a non active but later seller replaced and made sure that i receive a active product . i am really enjoying the wireless keyboard plus mouse pad in-build. Great quality üëçüèª. Working on my smart tv as well.
4,"I am using the item for my desktop PC and operating it from the other corner of the room which is quite a fair distance. The mouse movement is smooth and convenient. All the keys including the additional ones are ok. But the most attractive thing is the backlight which keeps on auto-changing while working. Overall, it's a great value for money. And there is a warranty card also which promises 1 year coverage.However, the user manual is inadequate. It does not mention how the backlight can be turned on and how to wake up the item from sleep mode. Also for the first time user, it may be difficult to find the usb remote which is hidden at the back inside the battery cover.Anyway, if you are looking for a handy and attractive wireless combo at an affordable budget, don't think too much. Go for this item.Also thanks to Amazon for their prompt delivery."
4,Growing up I couldn't even imagine about things like this but now cannot imagine my life without it. Technologically we have progressed so far in the last 25 years....... I use this mainly for my Smart TV.It is easy to control some apps with this mainly YouTube. Thank you.
1,Stopped working just after a few and seller is no where to be found it didn't come with battery aswell and i had to get my battery from an old keyboard i had worst experience from this company Viboton i hope after reading this review you guys will contact me
1,Pros:Fn+F2 for RGB background color then continue with Fn+left or right cursor for seven colors including RGB.Cons:Costly.Not good for gaming.Background light for 3 second.
4,The product is very good and value for money.The build quality is average. But finishing of the product is good. Very useful tonuse as a mouse with keyboard. You have to just plug the USB dongle to the reciever Nd you are ready to go.
4,The Colourful backlit is wonderful. However the Gamepad control keys are on Top instead of below. So it is bit difficult to hold and operate!
5,Video Player is loading.
5,"I bought it for my laptop, that I can connect it with my TV to watch OTTs. It is very useful and has backlight and many shortcuts. It is worth it. If you turns it off un unused time charge stands upto a month.Gaming it is hard and not recommended.It has micro usb charging port."
3,Use of the keyboard is pretty limited on television. It work while navigating and typing in an app but difficult to shift from one app to another
3,"Product is good,Packing is good also.Small keys drawback.For Smart TV volume is on F9 & F10.Silent mode on F8 & home on F5.No direct function control of volume,pause etc through this Set for Smart TV.If you want to buy for PC,then buy Logitech wireless Keypad and Mouse"
5,I used with android TV and laptop all features are perfect working. Bluetooth connection is fast and maintained well. Must buy.
1,did not even work on thomson b9 smart tv 40th1000 tried everything i could still no go.
5,"Works like a charm on my Sony 65 inch 8500 series , so handy that you can put it in ur jacket pocket in case you want to move around."
4,"Overall the keyboard is good and that with RGB .One think I want to make clear This keyboard is not made for pc gaming if you want to play emulated games (Cemu,yuzu,2ds,pS3)then it is good"
5,I bought this for my raspberry pi. Now I'm using it with computer while watching movies. Very handy for lazy people like meüòÅ
3,"Its a decent keyboard with backlit RGB. Considering the cost range, I was honestly not expecting state of the art ergonomics or RGB, for the prize range it does provide good value for money. However, you expect product to work atleast for a year without giving issues. For me, many keys did not work as expected after first 3 months. Apart from that, till the time it worked, it was a decent piece."
4,"Update: 2nd May 2019.....Changing rating from 3 to 4 stars. 5 months of gaming usage and it is still working!The product picture showed is not what I received. Two days of usage and the space bar gets stuck time and again. The keys feel very delicate hence this is not for heavy gaming. Perhaps not even casual gaming. Anyways, at this price do not expect a gaming keyboard.Update 8th Dec: Ordered a replacement and received it. Will post the update after using it at least for a week or two.Update 15th Dec: 1 week of gaming usage and the product is still alive. At the price I bought I think 3 stars is a fair rating."
1,"This is one of the cheapest and poorly made products I have come across.Let me tell you why:Pro's:None whatsoever. I would mention the pricing but for this product, that amount is overpriced as well.Con's:Everything people.In short. NEVER GET THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF YOU ARE A CHEAPSKATE!!"
5,I got this keyboard today and at first glance it looks awesome. The typing experience in this keyboard is good and I would recommend every basic user to go for this keyboard without any doubt. The keyboard it a bit flexible but as compared to its price point I can't expect more. The design of the keyboard has been upgraded as shown in thumbnail(just telling because I myself was confused with the pics of old review and the thumbnail)
1,"first time, i  received and packaging not ok, also looks many scratches .second time, i got aa replacement aand thsi keyboard shift keyis horrible and sseveeral  times ssame world is repeating..like this sentence.dont buy it"
5,"Got this Keyboard for Office use, the keyboard is sturdy doesn‚Äôt make noise and didn observe any cons ;If you are working from Home using your laptop I would recommend to get this keyboard or any other keyboard; we tend to type hard sometimes ; laptops are delicate and single key issue would make you run towards a service centre !"
3,"The product I received earlier has some faulty keys. Amazon replaced it very efficiently. The replaced keyboard is working fine most of the times, but there are many occasions where it stops working completely. The USB has to be removed and attached multiple times to make it work. Also it does not have options to change the inclination/height which is a standard feature in most of the keyboards."
2,It felt like a really cheap keyboard although it actually is a cheap keyboard but still the feel while typing or doing any work and the quality of the keys the press nothing was impressive I felt like a better keyboard in a just a little more budget would be far better than this but if I was trip budget then you can go for this you can easily do your work and it won't disappoint you.
5,I received the keyboard in a sealed packing however the mouse pad mention on the box was missing inside the package when opened. I am returning the shipment and expecting a replacement.
4,Good keyboard. Looks cool and durable. Keys are soft. The only problem I see so far is the Ctrl key (See the pic) it misses it's spelling. It's not a big concern but still company should take care of its finishings.
3,"keyboard is awesome but i have use it more than 2 months its alphabets are fating down ,color nikal raha haii , aagar typing ke liya lena hai ti mat lo bekar haii ungliya dard ho jayengii ,gaming ke liya  thik thak haiii but uttna aacha nahii ahii 1k ki price maii aur v aata ahii thoda aur jodka corsear ke keyboard aata haii wahii lo best ahiii gaming aur coding aur typing ke liya best ."
1,What a worst product..Key is jam like using railway station keyboard... Never recommend this keyboard. Your work may reduce to 40% only due to this jam keyboard
5,"Pros:1. Nice Build Quality2. Satisfactory press sound (which you expect from a mechanical keyboard)3. Dimesions are perfectly fine, not like other keyboards which take a lot of space on your table.Cons:No Cons!!!!"
5,"Very smooth around the edges and the keypress.,Prints on key also looks appealing.keys are silent.not a gaming keyboard tho.lets see how long it lasts ."
5,It's a cool keyboard which has soft keys and very responsive to the touch and it's is recommended for editing and typing.Not recommended for gaming.
4,"works fine, few letters came off (not the key itself, but writing on it). Mainly used keys are OK."
1,Worst Product.....The keyboard get failed in three days and even I can't return it now as all I don't have the product cover.Extremely disappointed !!!
1,It doesnt work waste of money. Please dont buy.i bought this on 7 th september and used it for 18days and thus went off. No breakage or any physical damage. Useless cheap boards are maybe i side this.
5,It is a very good keyboards at this price range. Recommended to buy this for those for plan at this budgetCorns. Led of Numb lock  n captions is very deemp
1,Produxt went bad within 1month of purchase and due to pandamic we arr not able to replace as visiting service center will take more time
2,Appearance is good. The functionality is worst. Some keys won't function and some keys repeats if you press once.
4,Quality of keyboard is acceptable in comparison to its price.
5,It is very good with all keys and it works with just a touch..
1,With great hope I have order combo but I have received damaged mouse ...it's very disappointed ...so I return the product and order another one hope I would be getting good quality product.
3,"USB cable is of very poor quality and very thin. But for the price, no complaints. Not suitable for gaming."
4,Low price good quality and good product.
1,"Amount was reasonable, very smooth for handling too may be. But I don't know why the package was not good and safe because when I opened I found two broken pieces of Keyboard. Immediately clicked for a return."
4,Works well. Mouse is very flimsy and not very reliable or sturdy but for the price cant complain
2,Side corner damged Keyboard...  Quality is not that much good and  Z key need to put more pressure to work. Not worthfull for 400
5,Nice Keyboard And Mouse......Really Good Looking.......And Working Fine........Worth The Money
4,"Value for money, but the cable is a bit short of length compared to others, and I had to drag my CPU a bit closer.."
3,Overall keyboard worth the price but switches are not much comfortable and not working smoothly compared to dell/iball/microsoft keyboards. But this is a good product in this price range..!
1,The keys have become so hard. We need to press several times to give the input commands
1,For one click it types more alphabetsSome time keys not functionsWhat to do now return date also overRaw material smells
2,The keyboard start giving issue in 2 mths where the keywords does not work and enters wrongs alphabet
3,Satisfied the product
1,"After 2 months of use, the keys are getting stuck when pressed. Do not buy it."
5,Excellent product
4,First thing is that I didn't received the Mouse Pad with keyboard as said in product title.
3,Well the pictures shows that the product can light up in different colours at once but it has only 3 different times but overall the interference is much better than most
1,"Updated Review: Horrible purchase.You can't clean the keyboard easilyThe keys flick out while typingBattery life is super awful for both mouse and keyboardBought 3 sets, all 3 same issue. It isn't cheap because the experience and aftercosts are awfully excessive. Regret it with utmost frustration.Old review below isn't valid anymore but leaving it so you can see what really happened and how awful this set is.Old Review„ÄãOver the decades I have purchased many Wireless Keyboard-Mice set including big brand names like Logitech, Microsoft and Dell. While they are good quality but are often too expensive for most buyers or the lower range sets do not have the quality required. This keyboard and mice set by Zebronics is finally the answer to both the problems.Pros:1. Sturdy make and elevated keys are really super convenient to use.2. Very easy to clean and maintain without much hassle3. Battery lasts really long and best point - single battery each for both keyboard and mouse.4. Mouse is just the right size, neither too bulky, nor too small.5. Low Battery indication is super handy in the keyboard.Cons:1. Mouse does not have low battery indication but then again with only one battery requirement, its not a big one2. No Indicators for Num, Scroll, and Caps-Lock keys being active.If you look at the entire package, and pricing, it is great value for money. I was skeptical at first but after buying one set and seeing its performance over 6 months, I purchased yet another set and intend to replace all sets one by one with the Zebronics Companion 102 model specifically.My recommendation - GO FOR IT!"
5,"Have been looking a good range wireless keyboard for a very long time and now i can lit up my head that i have got a perfect wireless keyboard and mouse. I strongly recommed it to the office users as most of my presentation i bring up laptop and all the time i have to walk near the laptop to change the slides, now why worrie? when i got this wireless keyboard to change the slide from the place where is stand. I also use it for my personal home use where i can sit in the couch and watch my fav movie from lap and no need go near to the lap to change the movie just sit on my couch and use my fav keyboard...Zebronicz is always the best in the market and this item is far good.. I blindly recommend it.. I give my personal guarenntteee.."
3,"I ordered this combo pack and was promptly delivered the next day. Thanks Amazon for the experience.The keyboard required 1*AAA battery and the mouse needs 1*AA battery which fortunately comes along with the package. The keyboard has floating key design which has good tactile feel to it and so far has been crisp. However the same cannot be said for the mouse as it feels small in the palm and has very inaccurate pointing.Overall, when compared the price with other big brands this package it an essential VFM product.Edit: Reducing a star because of the poor performance of the mouse, it lacks precision and battery life awful"
1,"Cheee worst, this keyboard already stopped working and thanks to amazon for selling worst products at cheap price without maintaining any standard. No customer service from zeb as well wasted all my money"
5,"Guys this product is too good üëå in its range ... I bought it in 9‚Ç¨ price might be fluctuate as per demand ... Lets come on its review keyboard buttons are amazing , sensitive enough , design is well and good  , connectivity is at its best . Mouse design is ok , connectivity is super awesome ... I would recommend u guys to go for it üòÅ I am totally satisfied with it .... Go for it üëç"
5,This combo of keyboard and mouse is very useful for daily activities on laptop l. The precision is good and the in built design is good.The only issue is sometimes the keyboard is malfunctioning sometimes and goes on typing the same letter for so many times.
5,Bhare!!Jordaar..
1,Disappointed by the product I received. This is the 2nd time I've ordered this product and I'm having the same issue. In previous order also the mouse was damaged and now in this order also the mouse is damaged.
5,By far very good if anyone wants a budgeted keyboard and a mouse go for it.Just an issue the light in keyboard if at night or dark room you use not so effective bus looks great will suggest to buy it.
5,Mouse battery consumption is too high
5,"very user friendly , light weight, responsive keysthanks"
5,As a gamer i always love to use a wireless keys and mouse but not all are worthy until.i find this awesome keyboard trust me one of the best in Market and makes a best in Amazon store. Now i can take my place in my room and connect wirelessly and play my game anytime anyplace best for our generation ppl
5,"Everything is fine, except the absence of light indicator for. Caplock key. Battery for Mouse drain fast."
4,"This wireless keyboard is very good as expected. But with regards to the mouse, the build quality and the look should have been better. And both keyboard and mouse works really good. Good part is that have got batteries(Normal one, not a rechargeable) along with the packing that I received so no need of buying it again."
5,Vert nice and sleek product
5,It's a good keyboard & mousebattery life is longworks perfectly finedesign is new & nice
5,Pretty good. Soomth for typing and comfortable to set. Easy installation. Auto sleep mode great feature in this. That feature seems great.
5,Keyboard and mouse are of very good quality. The range is also very good as i m using it for my cctv. Works fine. Looks good. Amazing quality.
5,Very good product at reasonable price. Handy to use
4,"For a office purpose it's great good product , if u are searching for a basic wireless keyboard and mouse u can go for it"
5,if you don't give the battery it i okayBut low quality battery are loss u r reputation
5,Good product üëçüòπ
5,"Just enjoying the feel it, looks good on my table clutter free, i have been using it for a couple of month not on a regular basis and the battery is still running for me.The only concern for me is the keys of my keyboard as it is an island type and some time it gets stuck on cloths and other stuffs my only fear is ""I might loose it some day""."
5,"Recently I have purchased this product. One of the awesome part of this product is a single adapter can be used for connecting both the keyboard and mouse. I have using the keyboard and mouse for both coding and gaming purpose, it works good for me. And best of all is that it's price of 750rupees."
5,Always zeb good brand. It proves with this.
1,"I have used this product for 3 months and now I am suggesting you people not to buy this keyboard and mouse. Battery life is very less and build quality is also low. Please dont go with its cheap price. My mouse is not working properly. Sometimes it work. Sometimes doesnt. The light in its mouse is not optical means not invisible. For wireless mouse optical invisible light is must for more battery life. My keyboard is completly filled of dust which I cant clean. Finally I need to tell, please dont buy this."
5,This product has nano technology which is good and both keyboard and mouse need only one sensor
5,I am using this product from last 5 month.It's working good.Battery life also ok for my light use.Little issue in Keywords key it's remove easily.
4,Not comfortable to use as key rows are arranged on same plane.
5,As of now its working good but battery included with this worst. My battery stopped working in mouse.
5,Supr quality
5,Battery draining very soon
5,"It is working very good, lightweight, everything is good about it."
5,Very good product

5,Value for money
5,keyboard keys are going to smoothly
5,Good product
5,Good product
5,It is very nice product light weight and good for gaming
4,"Bought this Combo for ‚Çπ 509 (product + delivery) on July 20, 2018The Product is same as it is shown in the picture.Pros :1. Colour Combination looks stunning.2. Keys are Soft and doesn't make awkward sound click sounds.3. Mouse works fine and the response is also good.4. The Additional Keys on the Left and Right hand side of the Keyboard enhances the look of the Keyboard and adds shortcuts to Useful Tools.5. The Keyboard is some what Water Resistant like it can handle water splashes and drain out water from tiny holes (present on the back side of the keyboard).Cons :1. The Wire Quality is not that Good, a Flat Cable look which is not that of a great quality as Dell, HP or Logitech provides.2. The Mrp is ‚Çπ 619 and this Product even sell at a price between ‚Çπ 645 - ‚Çπ 950 which is totally not worth it.Conclusion :OVERALL A NICE FUNKY LOOK keyboard + mouse COMBO AT A DECENT PRICE RANGE (‚Çπ 450 - ‚Çπ 550)"
3,"Well it's actually a good combo for the price rate of 500.  But the mouse is not durable , on the first hour of use , the left mouse button stuck after double clicking ...,The keyboard on other hand is much better , the buttons are soft and silent , quality of keyboard is decent .....I m not going to order replacement (becoz of mouse problem ) ... As Amazon takes 1-2 months for exchanging this one with a new one , also there's a great chance that next time I will recieve a much worse product ...(from 2 times experience before ).... Also there was no packaging , the delivery boy just hand me the original box of this, no wrapping and Amazon packaging ...?"
1,"After 6 months of useageProduct was packed well by amazon and it was delivered on time.Key board keys r smooth and noiseless. Mouse responsiveness is to the markAfter 3 months of useage, the key board is not working properly. When I contacted Amazon customer service, they asked me to contact the brand and provided me with a number. The number is invalid and when I called Amazon back they told me to ""Google"" the brand's customer care number and talk to them. It's good for 3 month useage. If you are ok with it please go ahead and buy it.It's better you buy some other product from a decent brand don't go for this one.Amazon service is worst in this regard."
5,"Keyboard-I don't know about gaming but this is worth every penny. I was hesitant about its shape at first because it looked too over the top to me but I like it now. It's light weight and silent. It doesn't make the 'tk tk tk' sound when you type.Mouse -The mouse is good and nothing fancy, which is great. I hate fancy mice so this works for me. It makes a little sound when you click but it doesn't bother me much.Installation speed -I tried the keyboard and mouse on both a slow and a fast laptop to check the installation time taken by the products. If you have a laptop in a decent working condition, it would start working immediately after it is connected. But for slow laptops, you might have to wait for a minute or two. But I feel that's because of the laptop and not otherwise.Registration -It comes with one year warranty so you can register your product on their website and manage everything online. I loved that."
1,"Very poor quality. the USB connector was loose and the computer would keep telling me 'no keyboard detected'. The keys are hard are NOT ALL ALL smooth for typing. Within a few hours of use the keys started to stick and the keyboard froze, becoming completely unusable. My mistake was throwing away the packaging so i am stuck with this completely useless product without any option to exchange it."
4,Not highly recommend for gaming but for office work it good choice & value for money. The keyboard have multimedia shortcut keys
1,"Edit:Reduced the rating to 1 star due to following reason:Worked for about 12-13 days. And just as the return window expired, the product started developing problems. Some keys on keyboard appeared to be stuck for example character ""c"", ""m"", return key and few more just did not respond. After unplugging and plugging again, found that keys are working but now these keys were working over time. Feather touch these problem keys and the key strokes resulted in ""ccccc"", ""mmmmm"" etc. Tried multiple USB ports, re-installing driver, changing the keyboard ""repetition"" settings but in vain. Now I can't return the product also since the window has expired.The mouse still works but I don't trust the quality of it."
4,"While the look and the extra shortcut keys at both end are great features but when I use it for typing by keeping the keyboard on lap, it shakes a lot and looses balance.The keys are big and you need to press them deep. Another issue is with the noise of keys while typing. The keys makes noise even you shake it tilt the keyboard slightly.The wire used in both mouse and keyboard is not rounded and smooth. In fact it is neither flat too. Hence it feels pretty itchy when rubbed over your skin.Good point is it is cheap and light weight.Using it since 1 month and so far no issues .The Rupees symbol drivers are not found, hence as of now that feature is useless"
5,"I have now been using the combo set for close to a month. Initially, I opted for it because I found it cheap compared to the combo sets I have acquired and just did not want to spend much. I didn't expect the set to last long. But I have been extremely pleased to find that the set works better, and in some cases, much better, than the three or four Logitech sets accumulated by me which have this or that component not working properly. The keys of the keyboard are different in style to the Dell keyboard I have but equally good to use. The Dell is softer but much more expensive. I have kept a record of the Amkette set for future ref should I need to buy a set again. Great value for money."
5,"The build quality is good. For normal works,  it is just excellent.... For those who usually do rough typing or faster typing,  I would suggest them to go for Dell and Hp keyboard because I have personally used them and still using it. The delivery was fast. The combo is just fabulous at this price range... With budget between 500-700, u can just go for it. It a value for money product.."
4,"If you want a budget combo, you can definitely go for this one.Pros:* Cheaper price* Keyboard has as multi-media keys* Cool orange colour for arroys, WASD and media keys in keyboard.* Keyboard is compact and has a good feel for typing and amateur gaming experience.* Mouse is accurate and very responsive, you may feel a little bit slow in FPS games due to it's little bit low DPI.Cons:* The markings on the keycap erases after 3-4 months usage on heavy use, else I would have given 5 stars."
1,"I didn't play any games on it for 6 months after I purchased it. Infact I barely used my PC for those 6 months. As soon as I started playing PC games under 15 days the buttons wore off and stopped functioning properly.If you just want a cheap keyboard of light work, then it might hold up for a year or so. But definitely not recommended for gaming."
1,Update : Don't  buy it..Key stopped working in the 10th day of use.I have Bought this keyboard Just today.  Shall surely share an updated Review After 1 month of use.But Right now.I would like to tell you my Observation.Pro:1. Budget Friendly combo between 500 to 600 Rs.2. Nice Poppy Color looks great to eyes.3. Soft Keys make less noise when you use them.4. Finishing is Descent for the priceCons :1. The Text on the Button looks printed and Not very Attractive and Clear. Hope it doesn't come out.2. The key travel is too long.  If you dont like keyboard with long Key travel you may not enjoy the typing experience.To summarize it a good Keyboard for a Small Budget.
4,"---I got this product at 436rs (17th NOV 2017)Its been 1 and a half years now I'm using this product.Honestly, it is not a gaming mouse and keyboard combo...its the same as normal Mouse&Keyboard. the keyboard might give you a feel likewise but not the mouseFeatures:>Worth it under 500rs (I got this product at 436rs (17th NOV 2017))>Good build quality of keyboard and about the mouse you cant use it roughly.>my Keyboard isn't working anymore from last month. stops working automatically (Nov19).>mouse still working good.why should buy>at this price surely this is a good choice.why should not buy>If you want a real gaming keyboard and mouseUpdate: 18Nov2019 keyboard is not working suddenly, no kind of damage happens"
2,"Hello,I got keyboard and mouse combo, and felt its good, but when i connected mouse what i found was its not functioning well and it stops in between.  Seriously felt bad to purchased it from online as if it would have been from shop, i would have immediately got replacement for it, but I got stuck here, can you please replace the mouse for me please.RegardsNimesh."
5,"Keys are smooth,Design is fantastic.One extra star for all over the look.This keyboard is even better than Dell .Mouse is not that great but it is accpetable in its price & i think it is great deal in the price.NO issue at all after few months if usage."
5,I have ordered it for my son ..Excellent product ..laptop keyboard will make kids to see screen from short distance thus i ordered it.. It is really awesome.. you have one year warrenty hassle free you ca register it from amkette.com.It may not be suitable for gaming No RGB . But looks premium.Over all Thanks to amazon for recommending this order.. Amazon always ahead..
3,"Keyboard looks decent, about 3 months of usage works fine.It is not a gaming keyboard, so NOT SUGGESTED for gaming.The shortcut orange keys are made of rubber and good to navigate quickly.Can be used for laptop's extra keyboard or a secondary keyboard.Mouse looks decent as well wire quality is normal and sufficient length.Again NOT SUGGESTED for gaming.OVERALL its Average and can be used as a secondary Keyboard and Mouse"
4,"At this price its not a bad deal.  The keyboard is really good. Keys are responsive and quiet. The shortcut keys on left and right are a nice touch. They work without any additional driver s/w being needed but if you are touch typist they might put you off a bit....the alignment of the hands are slightly altered due to the left side keys.  the mouse is slightly small. the wheel is badly placed. if you use the mouse wheel a lot to scroll through web sited you will get wrist pain soon. to summarize the keyboard is good. the mouse, while not bad is slightly smaller and the scroll wheel placement is a pain"
5,"1.Decent product to buy within budget!!!2.Good for gaming3.Give feel of type writer but key strokes are on softer side while typingBeing an IT professional, computer related gadgets has to be best of use .It's of every day use for me and works really good"
5,"And the Amkette legacy continues. I love this product. Amazingly superb. Even the USB connector, the wires, the keys and the look... You won't believe, till you use it. Please see the photos of every parts, I have shared here. Thank you Amazon for another Amazing product from Amkette."
4,The keys have a nice long travel and feels sturdy. Have been using for 03 months now and completely satisfied with the product. The highlights on the keyboard look good. Quick access keys on the sides of the keyboard are a good addition to the keyboard. Overall the best budget keyboard and mouse combo available out there. Would recommend buying it.
4,"On a whole, for this price range the product was really good for office use and for gaming also it was some what better with no noise of typing and sturdy keyboard.The mouse was quite responsive with decent look.Only defect is the packaging it didnt came with the amazon packing, just a box like it came as you can see in the last picture, it was somewhat damaged outside the box so i was scared about the product but it was all fine inside as u can see the pics posted.Overall this product was good in this price range."
4,I happen to use this for my regular use and not for gaming. The keys are soft and the benefit is the multiple short cut keys that are available on the keyboard which are really working.I can not vouch for the gaming though.
4,"Perfect combo for the price. Initially I was skeptical while buying this for the quality as most of the combo available for this price are of worst quality and don't last more than 3-4 months. After using I find this to be perfect for regular/office use. If you are looking for a office keyboard/mouse combo this should be the one you can depend upon.PS: For Amazon, this is not for gaming and being a USB combo I don't think you should look for battery life."
4,"First of all I already own an Amkette Xcite Pro USB Keyboard and I have been using it for a year without any issues, so I knew my new purchase also would not disappoint me. I bought new Amkette keyboard mouse combo for Rs 427 at Amazon Grand Shopping Festival for my sister and she already loves it. The only con with this keyboard is it cannot be used for gaming, as still the UV coated keys fade away if you use for gaming."
5,So simple...but I think it's not a feather touch......When I received this package the box of the product I teared I think it happens at the time of packaging but product is perfect no complaintsAnd this combo pack is value for moneyAfter delivered this package I know about amkette's other combo pack valued of RS599/- it is more beautiful with blue colours and it's shortcut keys are on the above........Overall rating is very good
4,"Initially i got a faulty keyboard with the ""Enter"" key getting pressed with a feather touch which made typing impossible. Then got it replaced the next day.Post that everything has been fine with the keyboard.Mouse also works great.Good product."
1,"Horrible product, hardly 2 weeks I used and the escape and space buttons are inactive. Tried reinstalling the drivers, fixed sticky keys also.. guess the product is only not good"
5,"Well packed and awesome multimedia key u can acess calculator , my computer and mute with just simple touch.Nice key operation Thanks to Amezoe and Seller for great product with more than excellent packing for product safety. Go for it blindly"
1,"Don't buy this product .It's made in china, Also it feels cheap plastic used .uncomfortable for typing .should have priced 200 inr"
1,It's not even an year and the number keys which are above alphabets stopped working. I have barely used the keyboard. I haven't used it more than 20 times in a year. It's not possible for me to go to a nearby city in this period of covid to claim the warranty.
5,I was recently looking for a keyboard and after looking at few I found this one this product had the most  excellent design I had ever seen so I ordered it. After a few months of using it I can assure you this is the most ergonomic keyboard with clicks which are Satisfactory compared to a gaming keyboard I would recommend people who can't buy expensive keyboard to look for this.
4,"it is a good quality keyboard. The good thing is that keys do not make noise while typing.This keyboard has adequate space between the keys and the peripherals have some important keys like email, audio keys and more.Overall a good quality keyboard and mouse combination, look-wise also it is nice , easy to use."
1,The numpad on the right side of this keyboard is not working.  Not sure if any special keys to be used before I use the numpad. Tried options but nothing much on internet.My bad luck is that I haven't checked it till after one month of delivery date.
1,"After a month, the keys started malfunctioning. If you are typing something, sometimes the app gets closed, sometimes Google Chrome opens up, sometime mail box opens up. My son had to leave his class as when he was doing live worksheets, some random key while typing changed the current address (online class) to the home address (Google search). Don't go with the looks, it's the worst keyboard I have ever seen. Never seen such issues even when there was windows 95."
1,In my last post I mentioned about the keyboard not working. Now when I try to contact customer support- the number is not in service. Tried multiple other numbers but nothing works. How to get the warranty for the product when they is no support from the product company.
1,"Worked well till now - July 2021, purchased in July 2020. Keys are malfunctioning. Looks like this will last ONLY FOR ONE YEAR. If the manufacturer or Seller has any ethics, please replace immediately. Else, this is a poor purchase"
5,Purchased on 31 December 2019Good product with sturdy built body. Loved the look and feel of the keyboard and mouse. Not a small mouse fits the hand well. Also it comes with multimedia buttons which are an added advantage.
5,"Its wonderful product. but for some reason the numeric keys alone were not working after 10 months. It may not be the case with everyone. Not sure,if it has any replacement/warranty period ?Instant One Touch Multimedia and Internet keys access really handy.Noiseless and smooth keystroke help us to have quiet typing experience.key letters looks new... didn't fade away.Optical mouse is very good."
4,Value for money
5,Awesome at this price .but keys are little hard to press..overall you can go for it..
3,"Hard key's, not suggesting for daily use"
5,I like the structure of keyboard and it is also light weight which is very nice
3,Light weight keybkard keys are ok ok not bad
4,"Though not a gamer, I type a lot. I had a mechanical keyboard and because it was showing double-key entry problem so frequently in multiple keys, and cleaning didn't help, I decided to go for a new keyboard. However, a decent TKL mechanical keyboard in my budget wasn't available for purchase and hence decided to go with this mechanical-like membrane keyboard for the time being.The raised switches give it a look of a mechanical keyboard. However, the typing experience is not comparable to a mechanical keyboard. It does feel better than the usual membrane keyboard though. It does make some noise while typing, and it is not that pleasant like typing in a mechanical keyboard. So, if you want a silent keyboard, this is not the one for you. It does come with basic backlighting. RGB colors are available but without many options. Three brightness levels are there, and a dedicated key to toggle light state. Windows key lock function is also there. Though the product description says, 'Dedicated Software Application' is available, I couldn't find one in the Amkette website.Coming to the typing experience, the keys are comfortable and spacing is adequate. I could achieve an average typing speed of 54 WPM with 100% accuracy. It is reasonably good. The build quality is also good for a keyboard at this price, and it seems a well-built product to last. The braided cable (which is not detachable from the keyboard) is good, and the length is adequate.The rubber padding in the bottom is not good enough (and is not available for the top legs), and hence the keyboard tend to move around at times, especially with the top legs extended.The right arrow key in my keyboard wasn't working properly. It needed extra force, like press it down really hard, to get the key register. Anyways, I pulled the keycap and added a small piece of double side tape and it solved the problem. Though I contacted the seller, they replied to contact via WhatsApp and all. Since I could make it work, I didn't bother. It is too much hassle to return and get a new keyboard, and I needed the keyboard badly. Hopefully, it will last."
5,Got it today itself..First impression: Got a very premium look.Nice quality RGB lightning and effect.Elevated keys.Braded cable and magnetic ring.
1,"Was disappointed by this product.1- Packaging was open inside box - there was no seal on box.2- Didn't like the quality of keyboard.3- The USB didn't work on any of the points in laptop.4- Tried contacting support team of Amkette, they were fast with their replies but easily gave up and didn't provide proper support.So I returned the keyboard and got from another company which was much better and worked smoothly plus got a high quality mouse along with keyboard.I would not recommend anyone to buy this Amkette keyboard. The quality testing team is not doing a good job."
4,Bought this 6months ago and writting honest reviewPros 1.Best membrane keyboard which has a bit mechanical feel. using this for 6months and its awsome for games and typing 2.Rgb has 2 modes and its sick in this price range(899) 3.Awsome design and compact there is no TKL keyboard in the market at this price range really boosts your setup look.Cons 1.Spacebar feels dumb but i get used to it and its fine now 2.I got a problem that this keyboard jams and pauses mid game when rgb is turned on think its a defect only for me but its  fine i turn it off during some games(problem may be in my usb port not being able to give power for rgb lighting) 3.To make rgb feel nice they used some transparent like color for printing letters which lightly makes it glare if you use it without rgb (with rgb it feels good) 4.Keys are nice to press until now (nearly 7 months) but i guess it may wear over (semi mechanical feel)Nice buy you can buy this if you fixed your budget under 1k otherwise go for cb mechanical @ 2.5k overall satisfied with this product.(Mark usefull if you found it usefull)
5,"I received the item with a surprise gift from the seller which is a gaming mouse by the same brand. About the keyboard, I really can‚Äôt comment as this is my first mechanical keyboard, as I have been using controllers for a long while. I didn‚Äôt find anything to complain about. Other tenkeyless mechanical keyboards are way to expensive. It works with my PS4 for COD Warzone and Fortnite. Also with my laptop. Mouse is decent too. Thanks."
4,"Delivery and PackagingI received the keyboard in a pretty limited packaging. It did not come with any cushioning to protect the product either. Moreover the product package had no seal of any sort which made it difficult to determine whether the product is a brand new one or a refurbished one.Typing ExperienceThe typing experience on the keyboard feels quite decent for the price that I got it for (899/-), and provides a decent feedback while typing. Admittedly, I haven't typed on mechanical keyboards before, but I guess this is as close as it gets to it at this price range. It feels like a marked improvement over the keyboard on my laptop which says a lot because my laptop has one of the best laptop keyboards in the market (Thinkpad keyboard). The back-light on the keyboard has three brightness levels and can have three effects (which is honestly useless to me). The colors of the backlight cannot be changed and only the breathing effects can be changed. So please keep that in mind. The backlight can be turned off if necessary, but the caveat is that the texts/numbers on the keys are hardly visible when the backlight is off. I'd have liked to have one color all over the keyboard rather than a gradient of colors, but that is kind of a personal preference. Something to keep in mind, and probably not a big deal for more experienced individuals. The keyboard wasn't difficult to get used to since it's compact and my fingers fall perfectly on the keys. The keys are spaced out quite well. It includes a couple of foldable stands underneath the keyboard that angles it for a better typing experience.Build QualityThe build of the keyboard leaves a lot to be desired. It does not seem durable. I'd be surprised if it lasts me for over a year. One of the screws on the keyboard was already loose and I had to manually screw it back in. A couple of the keys have their keycaps looser than the others. The quality checks on these keyboards don't seem to be too stringent.ConclusionThe price is where the keyboard is forgiven for most of the aforementioned shortcomings. Compared to most keyboards in the price range, it is one of the best and serves it purpose well. I'd recommend it as of the time of writing of the review."
1,"Let me tell you all the consFirstly if you are a mechanical keyboard user like meYou should not even look at this product as this product is membrane (feeling of going from a mechanical keyboard to membrane keyboard is noticable)Chances are you will feel like it's hard to press single keyI might say single keystroke requires 90+-5 grams of force to pressThey say it has anti gosting keys(let me tell you the buyers of this product)anti gosting works trash as I said 90+ grams of force to press (keys take time to register)Your hands will pain like hell if you are not used to such cheap keyboardI myself use zebronics max pro mechanical keyboard I switched because my w key brokeIF YOU ARE A GAMER DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT AT ALL""LONG SESSION OF GAMING MAY INJURE YOU"" I got the product (RETURN AND REFUNDED)"
5,"I have bought a new laptop and started feeling that the in-built keyboard might start to malfunction if I use too much (majorly because of gaming and typing keystrokes). I shortlisted two keyboards for my needs.1. HP K500 Gaming Keyboard (which was priced a bit more above than Rs. 1000, but was quite affordable);2. The Amkette EvoFox FireBlade Gaming Keyboard.I decided to go with the Amkette EvoFox FireBlade as I had bad experiences with HP products in the past (I have a 2nd laptop which is from HP and has keyboard and GPU issues; I got a HP mice and it died within 6 months of usage; and then there are more HP products I've used in the past which had given me pain).I got this keyboard and have been using it for quite a while now, and it is excellent for me at the price I got it for. The keyboard would be an excellent choice for people of both the worlds i.e., for someone who needs it for typing or for someone who needs a gaming keyboard to get started with in the gaming world. For a gaming mice to begin with, you can go for the Logitech G102 Light Sync. Back to the keyboard - The keys are really sturdy. The USB port is very well built. The braided cable (alongwith a magnetic ring) is fantastic too. The keys give an excellent tactile feedback while typing and gaming (as I type and game a lot). It is a TKL keyboard which results in a compact form-factor. You can bring up and down the brightness of backlighting of the keyboard with the Fn + Page Up or Page Down keys. There are shortcuts for multimedia (which is the least used feature for me).I assume it would survive a nuclear disaster or a zombie apocalypse someday (LOL, the keyboard is really good, to be honest). I remember, I accidentally poured a full glass of water and it survived and still works as brand new (LOL, seriously).What could've been a bit better:1. The backlighting. Don't get me wrong, backlighting is bright enough and lights up every key (but don't expect LEDs under each key) but the keyboard has only one mode of backlighting (breathing mode) which is kinda boring and might feel a bit cheap. And then, the right arrow key's backlighting is a bit lower than all the keys' but I am fine with it because of the pricing of the keyboard.2. Now, I would be really nitpicking here considering the price is really cheap but, the keycap of the spacebar is removable and scares me a lot, i.e., I fear it would come off some day if I stress it too much by typing or doing gaming (but thankfully and luckily, still hasn't come off. LOL)Overall feeedback :For someone who is looking to buy a gaming keyboard under Rs. 1000, this is certainly a better buy.  The performance and features it offers surpasses over the things that are needed to be improved. For me, it is a 4.5-star rated keyboard out of 5-stars (0.5 star deducted for the improvements this product needs)."
4,"I Got this beautiful keyboard in a single day delivery and a price of Rs. 1000.  I have been using a mechanical keyboard for some time and must accept that now am a fan of mechanical keyboards due to their smooth typing feel.Since mechanical keyboards have clicky switches, you cannot use them in the places, where you have some colleagues working with you. Due to this reason, I was looking for a keyboard which could provide mechanical feel with less or no noise.After a lot of searches, I zeroed for this one and after using it for a while, I thought of sharing my experience as a review of this keyboard.Starting with the pros, this keyboard provides the right mechanical feel and you do not feel any pain in the fingertips even when you type for longer periods. There is ample space between the keys hence you make fewer mistakes while typing. The keypress is deep and for people who are using mechanical keyboards for this particular reason, will find it satisfying.There is rainbow lighting provided in this keyboard which means every key has a fixed color LED behind it and you cannot change it. You cannot set a single color for the whole keyboard (which by the way is a feature of higher versions of the gaming keyboards). For people like me who are using this for typing and coding purposes lighting do not come to picture at all. I do not keep the lights open at all, even if they look beautiful and HI-FI but they may interfere in your concentration while typing. You can switch on/off the backlight using a dedicated key provided for that in the keyboard, also you can change the lighting modes using the Fn+ pg up/down buttons.For gamers, there is also a windows lock key, which means you can lock the windows key, which sometimes kill the gaming experience by popping up the start menu.Coming to the keystrokes, the keys are soft enough and not much clicky. It is somewhat near to the Cherry MX Brown/ red versions of the mechanical keys. It produces less noise but still, when you click the space bar there is some sound.The plastic used in the keyboard look decent (as per the price), the cable (around 4ft) is braided one which means it is entangling free. There is also a height raiser provided at the backside which helps you increase the height of the keyboard to provide a good typing experience.For the limitations part of this keyboard, as of now, I have not found anything which I could mention on the negative side. However in future, if I come across any cons, I will put them up here.Overall, it is a great buy for gamers as well as coders like me. Its a bang for the buck."
5,"This product is really amazing in every aspect.I needed a backlit keyboard for my laptop, as it lacks one, and this keyboard is just perfect for me.Moreover, though its not mechanical, but it feels and sounds just like one.Cable - Nylon coated Braided cable. Very strong.The USB pin is also very well built and looks very sturdy.Lighting - 3 levels of brightness + you can on/off the rgb lights as per your need. This is already brilliant in this price range, don't expect ultra-premium features at this price.For an idea about the size of the laptop, it is about the same size (in length) as my 15.6 inch laptop's inbuilt keyboard.I got it for 750 Rs in amazon great indian festival with lightning deal at 900 rs + rs 150 off due to rupay debit card. I am really happy to get this epic deal.Trust me, its the best keyboard you will ever find in this price range."
3,"Let's start with what's good: It compactthat's it.key size felt kind of ok for me as I'm habituated to larger key size and prefer them, it braided cable but the quality is low, the same goes for built quality and key pressing feedback.So to sum it up if the keyboard cost around 600(based on built (quality) I would be ok or if there was no better keyboard at 900(its price when I bought it)."
1,"Writing review after 2 Months of use.Some buttons has become hard. I am into programming. I type a lot. When i try to press some buttons it doesn't press sometimes. It has become thay much hard.Some dust might get collected below keys and made it rough. But the real problem is non detectable keys.After keys get hard, i have to throw it away. There is no option to clean it. Even i had mailed to their support team . But they are busy only in selling products.Seems like TYPICAL CHINEESE PRODUCT.DON'T GO FOR IT. It's just a matter of time you will start to face problems and you have to throw it in dustbin."
1,"If you are looking for a good keyboard with good feedback and comfortable ergonomics, then look elsewhere.This is a keyboard which would not make you happy.First and foremost, the build quality is absolutely shambolic. The paint is of low quality. There no defined lines. The letter start vanishing within 6 months. The buttons are loose and tacky. Shake the keyboard a little and you will knowSecondly, the feedback on this keyboard is extremely poor. The buttons get stuck while typing often.The response time is very poor for gaming too.The lighting is just a set of 5 LED lights under the keyboard with fixed colour.I regret buying this.Just look elsewhere for a quality keyboard."
2,this keyboard is really good for its price. Its keys are really good and it is great for gaming.I am giving it 2 stars because after 2 months of normal use it has stopped working properly.When I plug it in all the lighting effects work but I cant type anything. The keys won't register on all the devices I've tried. Also I contacted amkette around 1 month ago and they still haven‚Äôt replied.
5,"The backlight is good on this keyboard. The brightness of the light can be controlled, which is a good thing. Different combinations of light is not present, which is okay if we consider it's price. It's a beast when it comes to gaming & multitasking. It makes our lives much more easier thanks to the shortcut keys, which are present on this keyboard. I also like it's compact design, which is not a full sized keyboard as the number keys are missing. Buy it if you like small compact keyboard layout."
4,"PROS:1) Small and compact2)brightness of RGB well3) comfortable for eyes4)cable is braided, hence tangle free5)plastic and key quality good6) mechanical keysCONS1)no numpad 1-202) only TWO RGB options (fixed and breathing with fixed speed)3) green, red, blue from left to right--that is colour are placed in fixed positions4) Since no keys just right to arrow keys, you will definitely miss those shortcut buttons for JUMPPING/CROUCH etc which you are used to many games"
3,"Ohh boy I expected something great but for 1000rs I would say okThe keys lit up well and they do a great job showing the key character at night (some don't show it that well ..It's a sparay painted nad laser removed the outline so if you scrape off the plack stuff you might actually illuminate the damage aswellYou can do this cool thing just signed your name using a sharp tool now the signature illuminates (I said ""you can "" but don't do it if you want to loose your warrenty )(It's a 3 mothns warranty not 1year )The keys sound no where like mechanical and doesn't even feels mechanical they key travel is very impressive so I give props to that .If you have big Hands avoid this the key caps are a bit smallAnd the part where the wire attached to the keyboard is flimsy and I think might wear down quickly.Braided babel but it's for show it's early tearing apart at the junction .Over all for 1000rs -OKbetter buy this at 800-850rs"
3,"I bought this back in June and have been using it for almost around 3 months now. So far, the keyboard still works fine but for its price I definitely think it could have been of better quality.The pictures are definitely somewhat deceiving as it doesn't look as premium when you get the actual product. The paint job seems very cheap and the RGB lighting is very subpar. Stand outs though, it is a TKL (no Numpad) so for gamers who have less desk space, this is definitely a great keyboard.It definitely is anti-ghosting - so that's a plus. Hope Amkette looks into making their products look and feel more premium for the price because I feel like this keyboard could have easily been sold for 500-600 rupees. If you're willing to increase your budget by an extra 200-300 rupees, go for another product is my final verdict. I'll try to wear this keyboard as much as I can before purchasing a new one."
3,"Not happy with keyboard, returned it an hour after I got itI was actually looking forward to using this keyboard because of its reviewsThe keys on the keyboard shake a lot and are very flimsy, they wobble too much and when they do so, it sounds like Lego blocks moved around in a boxIf I press the keys in the center of the keyboard the whole keyboard dips into the center and that shows its pathetic build qualityWhen I typed using it, my speed was better, meaning it could be used for gaming due to its low latency ,but gamers need sturdy keyboards tooThe paint job is super bad, you could make out errors on the many keysThe RGB lighting looks good, but can be better with more color optionsAlso when I click on the 'E' key, both the D and E key gets pressed, so a big no for typistsAlso when my brother was playing Valorant, during the game the keyboard started malfunctioning, like if you hold W, you're supposed to move forward, but in this keyboard if you hold W, the game registers it as if I'm spamming W a few times in a second, so the character doesn't move constantly but keeps stopping and moving forwardVerdict: Dont go for it dear gamers and typists, the redgear blaze manta is a better option in the same price rangeVerdict : don't go for it, won't last long"
4,"Only the spray painting below the keys is not at all good. Looks like it has been done by an ignorant amateur. Green Red Blue colours are static. AWSD keys area remain green, Space bar area is red and cursor keys area is blue. Only breathing effects of lights under keys and no colour change. Good keyboard to learn typing. Keys don't make loud clicking noise when pressed. Braided cable is long. Occupies less space and costs less so one can buy."
1,"I am totally disappointed with the packaging. The product came in a squished package and almost damaged. Blue colour from the cover got on to the silicon cover in patches. It's not sticking properly. Longer and wider for 14"" laptop keyboard. Doesn't fit properly."
5,"Crystal clear keyboard protector. All keys are visible properly. It fits properly on a 14 inch laptop, protects the keys from any kind of dust. It sits on the laptop very well, no need to stick it. Just what I needed!!"
2,"From packing to product, all disappointment. Slightly larger than my RealmeBook Slim, so i had to cut it. Also no adhesion was there, I had to use tape on both ends to stick them so that they stay in place."
1,Its not sticking properly ... and its size is also big so now its coming on my mouse pad as well... transparency is bad with lots of blue marks on it...
5,"Non slippery,Easy to Use which I liked the most and this is my second one for my office laptop. Happy with the overall fit"
5,Excellent accessory to have for any laptop user. Easily stucks onbthe keyboard and removable for washing.

3,"Doesn't stick and received folded at a side,didn't straighten at all!"
1,Quality is very poor. Very cheap china item. Not usefull. It doesnt stick or stay on the laptop. translucency is very less. cant see keys properly. Will probably throw it away in 2 days üòÖ
5,It is a great product at this price.It has good adhesion which doesn't allows any dust particle to penetrate.Protects your keyboard from any spill.
1,Lost the glue in a week. Please don't buy it

1,it is not sticky and it has been mooced ehen we try to type
5,Good Quality Product. Useful item.
1,Well it is smaller than my laptop keyboard space.
5,Quality of the product is very good
5,This silicone keyboard protector is of very good quality .. it fits perfectly on my laptop which is a 15.6 inch HP laptop .. it secures the keys well and doesn‚Äôt let any dust go into the keyboard .. it gets stuck on the laptop from all 4 ends thus closing all spaces so that no dust can enter .. I really loved it and I‚Äôm totally satisfied with this amazing product .. a value for money purchase for sure and would recommend it to all!!
5,The Lapster Universal Silicon cover is very good product for covering laptop keys.It is dustproof and tranperant.Its built quality is so good.It is very necessary product for laptop users. It is also best in price.Value for money product.
5,Good product to protect keys of keyboard.This product is so much good and it fits to my keyboard of laptop. Earlier I was using but that was not clear but its to much clear and easily see the keys of keyboard and product keep my keya clear like new and fresh and The  product price is also low than market.
1,1. Not transparent. cannot see the keyboard unless strong lighting.2. does not stick. Poor Adhesion. Keeps moving when typing3. There were scratches in the product i received4 bad packaging. it was folded on one side and a few wrinkles.
5,"I am using dell laptop for long time and once my brother spilled fruit juice over keyboard during his online classes and many keys became sticky, So I thought i have to invest in solution of this to protect my keyboard keys from dust and other damages, this silicone protector sticks very well to my laptop keyboard and , all keys looks clear and haptic feedback is the same. Best purchase for my laptop."
1,"- dimenstions are not standard size- quality is pathetic- money is wasted, Not worth...- another junk item.Adhesion isnt good, stickyness is for only 1 attempt and later you cannot realign with stickness"
5,"Does the job. Its ment for normal protection from dust and accidental splash. Covers my 15.6"" hp laptop keyboard completely. Convenient and easy to use. Sticks in place without any issue and doesn't skid even with heavy usage.  Go for it as its value for money."
3,I don‚Äôt see the film to stick to the keyboard other than that the quality of the sheet is even good. It‚Äôs thick.Less rating is for the sticky factor. It‚Äôs not sticky at all. Poor adhesive.
1,"The packaging is horrible. The protector comes wrapped around a hard paper and the paper ink gets on the protector... The packaging is bad from the seller. And it doesn't stick properly on Acer Nitro 5, might work well for other laptops."
2,First of all it came with creases which stayed till this date. Secondly the material is not clear you can barely see the keyboard. And If I keep my keyboard a little bit levitated it slips down.Catches dust and gets dirty very quicky.
2,"It's not at all severing the purpose. For fan air it's flying üòÖ. It's not attaching to the keyboard, just a transparent polythene sheet."
1,"This keyboard skin or cover is just a piece of plastic that can get damaged once you start typing over it. This cover will carry some marks of poor quality material, if you begin putting impression over it.If you want something that is long Lasting and at the same time gives you a better experience, then go and purchase another one, certainly not this."
1,Very costly product not worth to its price. The sheet teared at corners within a month.The good reviews of this product is because vendor is sending 100 rupees voucher. if review is provided positive and screenshot is provided then 100 rupees voucher is sent.
5,"Slightly bigger for my hp laptop,but it sticks properly to laptop keyboard even without having an adhesive,the cover is pretty smooth too. Can be taken off and cleaned too."
5,This silicone keyboard protector is of very good and fine quality.It fits perfectly on my laptop which is a 15.6 inch Dell Vostro laptop.It secures the keys well and doesn‚Äôt let any dust go into the keyboard.The sheerness is really very good and it is so easy to use.I will definitely recommend it to buy this product as it is surely value for money.
5,This is really good and safety product for laptop. Through this the dust will not go inside keyboard and it will safe and your laptop will work longer. Material quality is good
5,This guard is good. It is made of good Material.Does not slips and does the job nicely.Overall a good buy.
3,It is costly here compare to local market. Easy available between from Rs 50 to Rs 80 in a market. Although it is doing its job perfectly.
4,Good product... Adhesion could have been better...
5,"Good product to use with comfort. Typing is not even an issue since the adhesion is really well. For those who are saying the Adhesion go after sometime, it's because of dust particles, just wash it with water and it becomes new and perfect.Very Easy To Install"
4,"Overall it is reasonable for its costIt is a bit big for my laptop, goes beyond the edgeFor now, It seems good, I'll update my review once I use it for a couple of months"
1,"This size is not suitable for latest generation of 15.6"" laptops. Better measure your keyboard size and then go for suitable size. Adhesive not good, cover slips as you type on keyboard."
1,"It's not sticking to to the laptop board. When the laptop is tilted, it slides and falls off.Feels like complete waste of money."
5,Bought this for my kid's laptop. This Protecting sheet helps from water spills. We use it while attending online. Nice product üëå
1,Does not adhere to the laptop keyboard very well. Moves around a bit. There is a permanent crease on one side due to the nature of packing. If you type continuously for more than 5 minutes it will move out of place. Fees more like a plastic sheet than silicone. Very disappointed with the product.
5,"The keyboard protector is very easy to install, and gives all round protection. It's universal, so can be applied to all keyboard kinds, and looks quite durable. Happy with the product."
4,Good one but slightly bigger
3,"The length is somehow longer for 15.6"" laptop. Also its width is a little bit wider which cobers one layer of my in built speakers."
4,Good product quality ok valie for money if rs 100
5,Very good silicon sheet cover for the keyboard....I use it on my dell Inspiron laptop and the size is perfect
5,"First things first!This is neither a mechanical nor a gaming keyboard. It is just a normal keyboard with colorful LEDs under the keys. Again they are not back-lit for each key. It is basically difficult to read the letters on the keys.However, I liked it because it is very nice when it comes to typing. It is light. Keys are responsive and very soft to type. The looks are very impressive with the colorful lights underneath keys.Also, I don't blame it for not being mechanical because at this price it would be obviously impractical to manufacture it.So verdict is, Good for home and home-office use. Not for Gaming.Oh! The last thing, I received a faulty one for the first time and requested for replacement. Both Amazon and Seller were prompt and punctual on the replacement."
4,Best KEYBOARD for gaming and light weight
5,"Have always trusted HP, never been disappointed. It's a light weight keyboard with backlighting. Three modes there... lighting, beating, breathing! The Fn key gives you some additional options which are great. The build quality is solid...metal top with good quality plastic keys. The lighting colors are sober and decent, nothing flashy about them. I wish the fonts (type) were a bit more legible. But, overall a great keyboard to buy for all purposes!Pros:Solid build quality.Sober lighting colors.Nothing flashy about it!The keys have a mechanical feel to themCons:The font (type) could have been more legible."
4,"Pros:Sturdy build quality and brand value of HPDependable anti-ghost keysGood key prints, won't get washed in 5-6 years.Anti-Spill proof.Cons:Key strokes never feel like mechanical.Lack of MM keys.RGB functions are limited.Value for money - this keyboard will easily last at least 5-6 years given the build quality. Don't expect too much about the feel as it's still just a membrane keyboard."
4,Compared to other gaming keyboards it feels I little underwelming but for this price it's pretty good. And it looks really great as well. It's also built in pretty good quality. At first I didn't want to buy this cause of the lack of many reviews but I'm glad I did cause I couldn't find any other keyboard in this good quality for such a decent price. If your looking for something at a low price but good enough to get the job done this is probably your best bet.
1,"While the lighting is good, please remember that the primary purpose of a keyboard is to be used as an input device. And this product fails spectacularly. Within 4 months of purchase, as many as 7 keys have become unresponsive. Contrast it with my Microsoft keyboard. It ran 5 years without a single problem.Left to myself I will never buy this product again. This is not a gaming keyboard. This is not even a normal keyboard. Even a 250 rupee keyboard lasts longer than this.Purchase decision: Watch and DON'T BUY."
4,"You can't change the light color. You can however change the lighting mode and brightness. The key press travel is enough for typing enthusiasts. The key face is smaller than expected and mis types happen, but when you get used to it in an hour or so, your hand tends to glide right. I have huge hands. Love the typing experience overall, lighting quality is amazing, but I would've liked a single color option too. Rainbow is a bit too loud for my taste. The key board is quite raised, you may need a wrist support for smaller hands. For gaming it is quite good. Cable is long enough to reach my CPU below the desk."
4,"Well, what to say about this keyboard as it seems to be one of the best in this price range. It doesn't have mechanical switches but can't expect it for this price lol. It's a full-sized keyboard with membrane switches that feels nice like pressing mechanical switches. It has rainbow color LEDs with 3 lighting effects and feels premium for the price. One thing I liked which can be a pro or con for people is that the letters are not painted on switches like every other keyboard, infact it's translucent which means that letters got the design from inside the switch. So there's no chance of fading. Lighting is good and doesn't hit your eyes but num lock light might hit you depending on the angle. Overall it's a good product if one can get this under 1100 then it's a good buy and below 1000 (somehow) then just don't look anywhere else."
4,Overall experience with the keyboard is satisfactory for a person who uses a laptop keyboard all the time.The keycaps are too high and keyboard itself is high which makes it difficult to reach the function keys.The 'fn' key is placed to the right side of space bar which makes it difficult when we use left most function keys [these keys are mostly used for media controls].The cable is not braided which is a minus.Excluding these reason everything works fine and for typing it is good. The keyboard has aluminium top with plastic back which is great for this price range.
5,I feel just amazing . its quality is superb as this range. I suggest that you can buy without any doubt.What I like:1) keyboard button üîò feel2) keyboard key button view quality both in day and night3) trusted brand4) premium feeling5) easy to clean6) rgb color qualityDislike :1) Cost2) no color options for keyboard body
2,"You'd think how bad can a cheaper keyboard be. You just need a simple keyboard with lights. But apparently there is no minimum standard for low cost stuff any more.Many reviews here speak of the lights and the unreadability. Its also the terribke choice of font that makes it so hard to read. And not only is it a bad font, it also printed badly, giving it that extra cheap skate look. The home key doesn't even look like home, same as many others.In usability, it is just alright, the bare minimum that one could expect in a keyboard."
5,I was skeptical initially as there were no reviews on this specific model.  But as a seller they had good feedback and took decision to try for  my  Dell Inspiron 15 - 3567 model.  Neatly packed and appreciate this as laptop keyboard is generally thin and  delicate to handle.  Installation took youtube help.  One observation is keyboard has metallic background where as original has plastic.  So while typing you can hear slight tapping sound.  Not an issue.  As of first day looking good.  Will post additional comments after few weeks/months usage again.
4,Just ask one more thing..Front view is as per your display but the back view of this product is without the black tape ...by which if some water me spill on it...it may flow inside the system....then how it is spill proof buddy...Remember the black tape behind the key board will safe from.spill..without it this key board just a simple key board...and may be damaged by spilling...sure
5,"Worked perfectly with first try. Replaced one i had purchased from a local repair shop which seemed shaky, but this one is much closer / similar to the original keyboard.So far so good.."
4,"The packaging and delivery was done well. The fit is not perfect though. The keyboard does have a barely noticeable bend and the space bar requires a harder than normal press for it to register. I bought it because I needed it quick and it does the job pretty well. So in short, pretty satisfactory."
1,Very bad productThe response time is very bad
5,This keyboard is as good as original one. Packaging was very good. It's a very good buy atan affordable price.
4,"You see gaps between the pad floor and the keys. But no problem with functionality. Replaced the original one with this, as the top number row stopped functioning."
5,Just blindly go for it it has nice tactile to the click and fitted perfectly well for my dell inspiron 5559. Its even better than  the keyboard i have replaced from dell service center that to with low cost.
5,The product is really nice and all keys are working fine.Quality of material also good.Recommend to all...Thanks to amazon to seller..üëåüëå

1,"Positive:1. RGB works2. Keyboard has a nice matte finish3. The keys are soft to press and overall responsive4. The logo is nice addition5. Price - and it was a lesson (dont buy cheap)Cons:1. The size of the keys is unconventional, i play CS GO and when replacing my lenovo keyboard assumed that the manufacturer will follow standards prevalent. But herein the keys are larger than normal which resulted in me having to change my game play (cannot duck anymore or in the middle of a busy firefight i end up on my windows desktop page!)2. Return policy of Amazon requires the product to be defective, damaged or not functioning. Hence i cannot replace this useless piece of junk because Amazon is more than happy to ship this back to me, albeit in a new packaging. When your product isnt in line with the prevalent manufacturing standards you (Amazon) need to have an option to return the product and for pete's sake just provide store credit if not a refund.Very disappointed Amazon.3."
5,"Writing this review is very emotional for me as I had to bid goodbye to it today. It was like an extension of my body for over 2 YEARS. It was one of the best keyboards I have used.I bought it in January of 2017 for ‚Çπ2000. Since then this keyboard has gone through a lot of torture. I play games a lot and many times I would hit the keys brutally during intense moments (READ RAGING). Nothing happened to it though. During it's service, it had tea/water/cold drinks spilled on it multiple times. Cleaning the keyboard and drying it was more than enough to get back at playing. The RGB Light intensity didn't reduce over the years. The Blue light is exactly the same as that of Logitech so it paired well with my G300S and G402. The Red is the same as that of the fans of my case so it was a match there too.Here are some of the PROSThe FN Keys are really handy along with swappable ""WASD"" and ARROW KEYS.The Wristrest is big enough and although made of plastic does not irritate the skin.It's a silent,""laptop like"" keys. Great for late night gaming.The keys are spaced apart perfectly FOR MY HAND SIZE. So no fatigue over long durations.But it has a few CONS too.Some of the keys (Spacebar, Backspace, etc) are not completely lit and it looks kind of bad but they are not easily noticeable.The RED BAND along the bottom stands out when the keyboard lights up in some other color.The Numbers in the NUMPAD never worked for me. Might be a software problem.To conclude, I would say that if you are not head over heels for Mechanical or ""Mechanical Feel"" keyboards, this is a good and durable keyboard."
3,Keyboard has ghosting issue serious one. You cant press s d and i at the same time. Other than that there is no problem. My Rs. 300 keyboard works fine. What a waste. I dont know why the S D I press at once when holding won't register as an button input. The uneven back lighting I can live with that.Delivery of package was good. I recieved the box a bit crumpled. I am giving it a 3 star
4,"If you are looking for the best, yet cheapest, membrane keyboard, then this is a great option. However, the keyboard is not free from faults. The size of the keys is fine and so is the cable length and weight of they keyboard. Coming to the review, I will first mention the cons:1) This is a well-built product with a full layout and some macro keys and dedicated media control keys. However, the placement of such keys is not something very well thought of. For instance, The multimedia keys for volume set is not as tall as the other keys and are behind the function keys (F2 to F4), so it is not comfortable to reach especially when gaming. Same goes for the media playback keys that are also behind the keys on the top row.2) Now coming to the macro keys (G1-G6), they are also awkwardly placed and spaced. The height for such keys should have been much lower than the standard keys. And if they were placed properly, finding the Ctrl and Esc keys would have been much easier. Sometimes I end up hitting G1 instead of the Esc key and G6 for the Crtl key.  Also, they are somewhat paired, There is some gap between the G2 and G3 keys and G4 and G5. If that exists for some hardware-related reason, then I cannot complain more.Now that's the only con I could find apart from one other minor con that's not a huge bummer for me, but could be for some folks. Read point #5 for that. Now, coming to the pros of the keyboard:1) Typing and sound: It's a typical membrane keyboard and feels like one. Typing is fast and accurate and doesn't make my fingers feel tired or lethargic. The keys are less noisy as compared to some other membrane keyboards. This was one of the reason why I didn't get a mechanical keyboard. Now I can type at night while others sleep peacefully. I type somewhere around 70-80 WPM, so I type a lot and it's comfortable with thi keyboard.2) Size: This is a full size keyboard so you also get the numpad. I don't like how  every maker is assuming that these peripherals are only meant for gaming. Good thing Redragon made this keyboard for both work and multimedia.3) Font: The font used for the letters is plain and simple, honestly, that's how it should be. Some other makers use such bad fonts that the keyboard looks like a mess and hard to understand. Thank you Redragon for using normal font. With this, the keyboard looks more professional and aesthetically pleasing.4) Wrist rest and Ergonomics: This is an ergonomic keyboard but not a dedicated one. And the wrist rest included is quite nice. It uses magnets to snap to the keyboard and is comfortable when typing. But if you lift the keyboard up for some reason, then the wrist rest won't hold to the keyboard and would fall off. Without the wrist rest, they keyboard would lose much of its comfort as it will raise the height of the keys.5) Lettering: The lettering on the keyboard is transparent. This is good for longevity, as the letters won't fade over time. But, if the RGB suddenly stops working, then the keys might be difficult to see. However,  You can still manage to see the keys in low lighting. In good lighting, they are clearly visible, although  not like a regular keyboard. So this might be a con to some, but to me it's not an issue.6) Anti-Ghosting keys: They say there are 26 anti-ghosting keys. While I haven't tested all of them, they work mostly. One odd thing is that Left Ctrl+Shift+Esc doesn't bring the task manager up. But if you use the right side Ctrl+Shift+Esc, then it works. Good thing they have marked the keys with a line below the letters.7) RGB: Honestly, I am not a fan of RGB, but they way you can just make the RGB glow at the lowest level is so nice. I can clearly see some keys that I rarely use at night without them shining like a car's headlight in my eyes. You can choose static light or random colors. Yes, white is there, so is green and red and blue and yellow and cyan and magenta. You can also turn it off and practice your typing at night. It's fun, trust me.8) Macros: You can customize the macro keys accordingly via the software or through keyboard. And because the keyboard has a built-in memory, it remembers the assigned function or key combination even after uninstalling the keyboard application. I have used the G6 for mute function, as this allows me to mute and unmute in a flash without moving my hand, just with my pinky. This is so important to me when gaming and using headphones, as it gets done in a snap. Extremely handy for my need.9) Keyboard lock function: By using Fn+F11, you can lock the keyboard. This is a nice feature that lets you lock the keyboard to not let any registering of key presses.I will update the review as and when needed. I hope this helped."
5,"I bought this keyboard for my second computer, which I use for typing. My main computer already has a Razer Huntsman Mini. I do a lot of typing and I have a high speed of about 110WPM(Words per minute) I know that I should have bought a Mechanical keyboard because they are fast at typing, But I just found this Shiva keyboard and I bought it because I have used Redragon's Phaser mouse as a budget temporary mouse so I thought let's buy a budget gaming membrane keyboard that also has macro keys. Even though it only cost me only about Rs2000 which compared to the Huntsman which cost over Rs14000 this keyboard exactly felt like I was typing in a Huntsman this is so good. It even has a consistent clear RGB that most of the budget gaming keyboard doesn't have. Most of the budget gaming keyboard has RGB that shines at some point and then there will be a part where there is no RGB. Love it"
5,My first gaming keyboard very good experience this keyboard thanks Amazon and redragon i love you
1,The product is not good for gaming...u cannot use multiple keys at the same time...i was playing cod and pubg...its the worst experience u can't peek while sprinting...while i m playing cod. Cant use socrestreaks when i press something not working in a way it should be...irrtating...the only thing good about this rgb lighting...worst buying experience..by time realised where was the problem..the return window time closed...to this product...ita a shame..
4,"Upgrading from a mechanical Dragonwar keyboard in a pandemic lockdown.I chose The Redragon Karura K502 as it was affordable and I love a good matt finish on keyboards although it is very difficult to keep it dust and stain free.Also, I've never done serious gaming (FPS games) with a membrane keyboard which has island style chicklet type keys. It looks very sophisticated. It is one of the quietest keyboards I've used come across and would highly recommend it for someone who has to type a lot and does not quite like the clickety-clack sound of keys. As of now I don't find any issues with the space bar key not registering or the enter key being too small or far away for the right pinky finger as noted by some fellow owners of this keyboard.It does take some time to get used to typing on it as the keys are spaced out (low profile membrane keyboard, much like them Apple Macbooks) but i believe that happens with every time one changes keyboards.Backlight on the lazer engraved letters on the key caps is not uniform but its definitely better than what I was using, so no complaints there for me. Font could have been better.I received the keyboard one day earlier than its scheduled delivery. Thank you Amazon India."
5,"I'm extremely satisfied. Don't listen to fake comments. Truly magnificent and a premium keyboard. Not a mechanical keyboard ,but feels so similar to mechanical keyboard. Excellent built quaily.üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºI don't feel any cons. Keys are soft and good."
5,"Edit - Well not the best I guess. The plastic really attracts lot of oil and grease from the hands. Also, this does not have n-key roll over so you cannot press more than 2 (or 3 not sure) keys at the same time. That's pretty annoying while gaming.I am someone who hates mechanical keyboards. I'd been using the HP Wireless Elite V2 for a few years. It was the best chiclet keyboard on the market. But sadly it gave up on me. So I narrowed down this beast. I never purchased reddragon products and was worried about going with them but boy oh boy has this blown my mind away. The quality is just amazing. Even though it is fingerprint and dust magnet, I just love the product so much.Just go with it. You won't regret it."
1,"Absolute garbage. The first time I ordered it, many of the keys weren't backlit properly, as shown in the photo. The f1 and all f keys were not working. On replacement I was facing the exact same issue. My refund process took more than a month. Very disappointed in Amazon and Redragon. This retailer has no ethics and made my purchase a miserable one. My order went out on 20th December 2017, I got my refund on 9th February 2018. Don't go for this garbage chicklet keyboard."
5,Excellent keyboard.Hand rest is very comfortable for long typing efforts.Has backlit green colour light.Cost effective.  Good for gaming and normal type work.Has additional keys G1 to G6.Good packing.  Thanks Amazon retailer.
1,"It is a good choice for anyone, but if you are taking it for very much of typing work at first your hand will slip over the keys so much, because they are flat. You feel like typing on laptop keyboard. It's brightness is not good daylight, in the dim room, it's good-looking.But after one month it has stopped registering the keystrokes for multiple keys. This keyboard is a kind of hit-and-trial product. It might go well in long run or might not.Also red dragon support team is the worst of all.Thank you"
5,"There are hundreds of -ve reviews about it. But still i bought this because it like simplicity, yet lively with RGB and a must have wrist support.Cant comment about durability. Will Play BF1, BF5, Fortnite, TC: Wildlands and update later."
3,"It's been at least 9 days since I'm using this keyboard. It's great but the space bar gets springy over time. You get that springy noise when you type on it. But well, who am I to complain about the price. It's great. But I would recommend going a little higher on your budget and buy a mechanical keyboard Like the redragon Kurama or the 551. But for the price, it's great."
5,"Soft touch keyboard. No annoying sound. Perfect for large hands, good wrist support! Key spacing is perfect for me. The sound is pleasant.I had to cycle through many mechanical keyboards over the last year until finding this finally."
4,It is very good for typing and gaming but if you game on it extensively it will clear the paint off the keycaps as they're not black keycaps but clear ones painted black and my A key has a small hole in it after daily use of 2 years and my s key has small dent in it overall the quality of the keycaps is decent but not good if you're going to use it 3hrs on a daily basis
3,First impressions give off a premium feel & keyboard looks excellent to eyes but keys could have been more evenly lit along with more vibrant printing to give a more premium feel (maybe due to its price). The keyboard material attracts lots of dirt especially oil based from hands & get very harder to clean & maybe never same the same look as untouched after usage. But overall it is fine.
5,"Amazing Gaming keyboard with ""best in class Rgb""Really handy and smooth Chiklet keysButton Precision is Good7 Rgb colours with 6 different Modes to choose withGot this for ‚Çπ1399Multimedia Keys"
5,"I was looking for a best keyboard with backlit for programming as my main purpose. I have tried other products around 1.1K (zebrionics). but that disappointed me .Pros:1) This a light weight and easy to carry keyboard2) Multiple lighting modes for few extra money (INR 1450)3) The Wrist rest is a great option supports your hand with needing additional support for long working hours.If you are looking for a backlit keyboard around ~12k, I would strongly advise go with this by keeping 200Rs extra, you will never be disappointed with this. I did the same mistake last time tried to save Rs 200 but ended up with less satisfaction. This time I got this wonderful product."
4,This cover is transparent.. easily foldable.. keeps my mac clean.. i can say its a high class cover for professional person who is addicted or regular to mac.I must say it is bit tough to get from markt so i ordered this online.. i gave it 4 str because i drop tea on keys and bychance this cover was over the keys its was like life saver for me and was extremely easy to clean it!!
5,"I was little sceptical before placing this order, but then it just turned out to be a right decision. It sits perfectly on new MBP 2021. Go ahead and order without a worry for your new MBP 2021"
5,Good product to protect keys of keyboard.This product is so much good and it fits to my keyboard of laptop.¬†Convenient and easy to use. Sticks in place without any issue and doesn't skid even with heavy usage.
4,"The quality is very good n it‚Äôs fits perfectly on my New 14inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro 2021.Looks Nice, using it past one week n seems No Problem. I turned my MacBook upside down but the cover didn‚Äôt fell off. I recommend ppl to buy it without thinking twice"
5,"A premium cover for my macbook.Material is good, thin and lightweight.Love it"
5,Go for it. Very thin & transperant.Perfectly fits to the keypad. It doesn't even move when you type.Cutouts are fine & Quality is good.
5,best price & nice product.quality material good.
5,"keyboard is clearly visible, it doesn't cover the touchbar on the top plus the Power button.The colors are extremely pretty and the price is a cherry on the top! Highly recommend this to everyone"
5,Good product to protect laptop keyboard. It fits perfectly and build is quite good. Does not slips and does the job nicely.
5,Nice product. i ordered due to WFH situation and ordered without much searching product reviews. zebronics has earned a good name and their products are good and less expensive. this product did not disappointed either. the keyboard is silent ( no key noise) well designed and very soft. mouse is also nicely designed. got connected in one go. no hassle. simple to user..very much satisfied with the product and definately recommend everyone to go for it.
5,"jazt amezing product.i write this reviw to use this product with just one day use, but keyboard and mouse is super silent. keyboard typing was nice. n mouse use it amezing. product looking also nice.jussst one disadvantage: the keyboard is bulky compare to hp. but i use in my office. so, no borther to me.overall paisa vasul quality."
5,For WFHNO issues like lag smooth button and mouse scrolling is perfect with the cursor moving speed DPI adjustment. Coding and working is suitable. Do not think just go for it
5,From all angles it looks and feels premium. Can fit into all professionals set up. Really good device quality and silent typing clicking is low key satisfying
5,"First of all there is no voice at all while typing any key on keyboard or mouse click. It's perfectly silent. Key press is buttery smooth.Build quality is also very good. It looks sturdy.Nice green color LED indicators for Caps and Num lock.Shortcut media buttons and calculator buttons are available.DPI control in mouse is another useful add-on.Overall, excellent product. This is a newly launched product just 2-3 weeks back.Anyone having the budget must give it a try."
5,"For what it worths, it does deliver. The buttons are a bit mushy so it doesn't give enough feedback which is subjective.Overall I do like the keyboard and Mouse."
5,You just cannot get anything better at this price range. Brilliant product from Zebronics!
5,I bought this after comparing Logitech ones and finally tried to give this a shot. The keyboard and mouse is almost noiseless. Helps when I work with my family around. The tactile feedback is good to get a enjoyable typing experience while maintaining the sleekness of chicklet keyboard. Mouse is small but fits the palm perfectly. Its pretty noiseless too. Instant pairing with no hiccups
5,I am happy with this key mouse combo. Since it is packing both wireless and has num key it is combo of both laptop use and PC use with small space. Overall happy with the purchase
5,I wish the keyboard has on/off button like mouse.
5,if you're interested to buy a keyboard and mouse with silent keys then this is the one.
5,"It is Comfortable, silent, works fineGo for it, you don't want the clicking sound of the mouse and keyboard."
5,"NICE PRODUCT,OVER ALL USE OF THIS KEYBOARD AND MOUSE IS...JUST AWSEOME."
5,Very comfortable keys
5,Very good for house for multi. Media use
5,Smooth typing with great build quality
5,everything perfect
5,Great wireless combo. Beautiful design and decent range. Keyboard is auto off when not used and mouse has on off switch thereby improving battery life. Highly recommended.
5,"Moving from my Circle keyboard and Logitech mouse, the very first thing that I noticed is how smooth and silent the keys and clicks are..!This Zeb-companion 500 combo is dead silent!!It is ergonomically appropriate for office use.Haven't tried gaming yet, but should be just fine.Both k/b and mouse have nice, sturdy build quality.Can't  comment on battery life yet; got it just today."
5,Awesome keyboard and mouse
5,greatest convenience. hassle free and tangle free.  performance upto the mark.
5,Nice set... Liked it

5,Very smooth and comfortable for daily usage
5,The design is pretty good and the product is satisfactory in the price range.
5,Nice
4,"Keyboard is average and value for money. Keys are little hard and take a extra force to press. Though one can be habrual of it in couple of weeks.  Only thing I have cut 1 star, because if there wjll be a option to have 2 receiver that will give freedom to use both mouse n keyboard separately."
4,"This keyboard is a little annoying to use. The box says quiet typing but it is not like that. The sounds of the key is a little higher than you‚Äôd expect but however, it varies from person to person. The mouse is good for small hands but for medium or huge it is a problem. Also the length of the wire for the USB is small and you may find it irritating. But I needed it for sometime. If you don‚Äôt have any problems with the things mentioned above, then this is a good product considering the price."
2,product is not so much good... but regarding the price it is good for some time use... for normal it is okay... but if you want to game then please with mechanical keyboard...this time I have not so much budget so I bought it for some time use... later I will buy a good mechanical keyboard and a wireless mouse
2,"You get what you pay for. Quality is satisfactory as per the pricing. Good for those who are looking for a temporary and less priced keyboard mouse. For longer usage and durability, I'd recommend other."
1,"Do not buy it.I dont know about the wireless one but the wired ones are worst.Apparently sometimes the keyboard doesn't take any input and the build quality is not good if you are gaming or writing and the mouse is even worst than the keyboard,it is very cheap plastic and continuously crashes the system. So overall not recommended."
1,"Key caps are not good quality although pressing keys feeling not as bad, internal keys are feeling good but typing speed not match as touch key caps not satisfied. as per price. 538 Amazon delivered at home a keyboard and mouse so price worthy."
2,made with low quality materials. First time it delivered as broken piece and I want to get refund but no option for refund only replace allowded. quality key board we get Iball or such other companies on same price.
5,As per price it good related to other also have 1 yr warranty All keys are working i suggest to some poor students this product at lower cost
1,at first I got defective piece. most keys were not working. then I initiated a replacement. got another piece but this time items were missing in the package. had to return it again
1,"Don't buy the mouse.  Not even a month product is not working. It shows usb not recognized. Even  some keys on the keyboard, especially the backspace button is hard.  I dont want to give even one start, but review is not submitted so I had to give one star"
2,Keyboard material quality does not value for money and key press sound is not goodBut overall nice working. It is good for 250 rupees keyboard and 100 rupees mouse. total combo price should be 350 rupees for quality of material
2,keyboard's quality is low. plastic material used in keyboard is bit vulnerable. Also key placement is not very good.
3,The key are little harder for typing .. and the mouse also not smooth ..
1,after 1 month keyboard and mouse did not work.
4,"keyboard quality is good at this price point, but the mouse is not that good. If you find the deal around 400 then only buy it. Good for tight budget peoples."
4,Price is good for the quality it provides. The material feels like cheap plastic. But if you're looking pass that then everything works fine.
2,The mouse button is hard. Not comfort.
1,Some or the other problems with the product.

5,I like it...I love Amazing Amazon Service
3,Keys could be softer otherwise good. The mouse started giving issues after a use of 1month.the keyboard serves the purpose.
2,"So I have never used a mechanical keyboard prior to this so keep that in mind while reading this review.First Impressions-It feels awesome and smooth, i never want to go back to using normal membrane keyboards ever again.ProsDecent switchesAwesome mechanical feelGood fontsMedia keysConscheap build qualitycable is not braidedBig keys do not have good stabilisersThere is no software so limited rgb functionalityVerdict-According to me, if you have never used a mechanical keyboard ever before, definitely go for this one you won't regret. This is the best you can get for the price right now, it is better than any membrane keyboard out there.Not sure about longevity will update in a few months.The cons are trivial and to me personally don't matter. Definitely go for the keyboard as it feels really light1 month updateD key's switch stopped giving clicky sound and became muddy and started getting harder to press, it works just fine but it feels like its malfunctioning, i replaced the switch to num lock since keyboard is hotswappable so not a huge issue, taking one star off my reviewAnother update- 2 more switches became muddy and clicky feeling went away. This keyboard switches suck ass i dont recommend buying this at all stay away from this..."
5,Absolutely awesome keyboard ‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô• Mechanical Keys are so goodü§óü§óü§óü§óExcellent Packaging üì¶
5,"For those complaining about the wobbly spacebar: take the spacebar keycap out, bend the metal stabilizer on the keyboard inward slightly and put it back. The wobbliness is due to no friction from the metal piece.Other than that, this keyboard is sturdy, clicky (though noisy) and is great for coding and gaming. The shortcut keys up top can be custom mapped in Windows or Linux. For $20 / ‚Çπ1499, you can‚Äôt really complain as most mechanical keyboards are above ‚Çπ2000 right now."
3,"This is my first time using a mechanical keyboard so I can account for the problems i felt because of not being used to it, but the keys are too wobbly and the noise is loud and obnoxious. The backlighting is good, the keys work well otherwise, which is a decent buy for the price. However, not a good purchase for working purposes/personal use apart from gaming. The size of the keyboard is far bigger than expected in terms of both length and width, so best works with hand/wrist support."
4,"gaming is good i would have preferred brown switches..you can swap the ""WASD"" for brown switches from cherry mx..the smaller keys are well stabilized and produces a satisfying click( if u are into that otherwise u might find it annoying)but the right shit and the space bar is not well stabilized and producers a metal janky sound and is not as springy as i would like it to be..the backlit is fine with few different combination to choose from...then comes the cable..i will say it is decent..just decent...then comes the enter key...that thing is wobbly.....oh oh there is another small thing..sometimes the input of ""WSAD"" and the arrow keys gets Interchanged...pluging it out and then in solves the problm..happened to me once...and the rubber pad are not very grippy so there is some sliding here and there"
5,"I got this delivered yesterday and the Initial impressions are that it is an excellent keyboard. It is very well made and has a nice weight to it. The keys are comfortable (the backspace, enter and shift keys are of the perfect size and dimensions) and tactile offering great feedback.The lighting effects are fantastic (Earlier I used an ANT 3400 mechanical and I think Quantum is far superior - for one, it remembers the last light setting on the keyboard). Various useful multimedia/special options are available on the function keys. I really hope this one lasts me for a long time!"
1,"The normal keys are good but quantum needs to fix the other keys like Spacebar , shiftkey , etc. Otherwise RGB effects are very nice.Edited after a month: So I just replaced the keyboard after 4 days because I having issues with the shift+w key so I thought there must some problem, so I just replaced that keyboard with the exact same model so when I got the new one AFTER A WEEK I used it the keyboard was working fine but the nest morning I had again the same problem SHIFT +W was not working properly. The conclusion is just don't buy this keyboard invest 2 thousand rs more and buy Logitech gaming keyboard which I m also going to do that."
5,Nice and sturdy keyboard. Just go for itüëç

1,keys stop working after you use them for a while and overall key quality is not good go for good membrane keyboards in this budget
1,"I purchased quantum hi-tech keyboard usb qhm7403d which is discontinued nowAfter usage of about 9 months, ctrl and windows key has stoped working.I checked replacing the keys but its internal pcb fault."
1,"I buyed it on 27st July and after approx 3 months ,many keys stoped working and many keys spring wire is missing in product. I'm am not using it for gaming, I use it for daily use as coding. Keys presses are good but for me it was wasted just in few months.Light options are there but those are not relevant to me , the lighting patterns are like some festival lighting, those may looks good but not for practical use. build quailtyis good.ruppee key didn't worked for me.Looms good but how long will it work, that is not sure ,if you will ask me. If you want to invest money, I will suggest to explore and find more durable product."
5,"I am very happy with this mechanical keyboard, especially at the price point it offered. After seeing YouTube reviews of this item I thought let's give this item a try. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the keyboard despite it's low cost. The light is nice (although color is not per key - but at this price you can't complain). Backlit keyboards in this price range usually look somewhat tacky, but this somehow looks classy despite not being expensive. The keys are reasonably designed. If you are looking for a cheap mechanical gaming keyboard - this is one of your best choices.I rarely write reviews, but this was good enough for me to write one."
2,While plying valorant and CSGO i discovered that many keys pressed at a time do not function... such as shift walk backwards you cannot equip from pistol to rifle and so you die doing that.... This is too annoying. why should I pay for something thats not even worth the price. Even my office type keyboard was better than this at least it worked that way.
5,"I've never used any mechanical keyboard, so my comparison will be based on membrane keyboard.Pros-Price lowFeels pretty good while typing.Keys are also goodNum pad for those who want it.Cons-The lightning effect is waste, it look more like Diwali lightning.It's quite heavy and bulky.There is no option to turn of backlitThe light is too bright to work in completely dark room. Not option to manage it.Most of one star review states keys stop working after few time. Soni guess I'll update it after few weeks."
5,"I've been using this keyboard for almost a year now, Ive gotta say... this is definitely one of the best keyboards that I've used so far.The build quality is decent and the keyboard feels very sturdy. The key caps may feel a bit cheap but you can always replace them (hell, you can replace the switches too).The rgb lighting is nice, and the click-y feel of this keyboard is absolutely divine (I think that this probably the loudest mechanical keyboard on Amazon, Ive tried quite a few).Overall this product completely surpassed my expectations. I can't recommend it enough, its an absolute bargain."
4,This mechanical keyboard is well-made though the multi-colored LEDs make it look a bit too flashy. A subdued look with single color lighting would have been much classier. The keys work passably well and the overall design is sturdy.

5,Go for it if you want your keyboard to be protected from water spills and dust with a perfect fit and a seamless typing experience without any typing noiseHas a good positioned hole for the caps lock light all the printed text and numbers are very good and bright
5,This is extremely beautiful since one will even can't notice if it is there or not unless you say it is there. It sticks to the keypad perfectly. Only thing is it is just over priced. Around 300 to 320 rupees would be correct. I am using it for my dell 5510.
5,"Just got the product.Initial impression is good ! Very transparent protector for my Dell Inspiron 5518. I have added both images with and without Keyboard Protector !But, I think is product is overpriced ! It should cost around 150-200 !If anything goes wrong I will update my review here !Rizwan!10.Nov.2021"
1,"it is not that premium that the seller is charging and this feels like and very cheap plastic cover not giving that good typing experience , it is not worth to go with this rups400"
5,"I bought this keyboard cover, because I spilled a drink on my Dell Laptop and didn't want to suffer the same fate again. I got the TPU model. It is clear, feels soft, and I can hardly tell it's there. It doesn't slide or move and I feel confident it'll keep drinks off the laptop this time around."
5,Guys Really go for it without a second thought..!! Perfect fit..Searched a lot before buying this..!! But this is absolute match for my 3511..
4,The finger print reader on the Inspiron 16 Plus will not work through the cover. Fits perfectly on the keyboard.
5,Perfect fit..quality and durability am not sure..but looks almost invisible...
5,I needed the extra protection. I wish the cover was more transparent but no biggie. It has the perfect thickness. I did have to get used to typing with it since its not as smooth.
5,Fits perfectly to my keys & backlight keys are also visible.
5,Fit perfectly on my laptop.
5,"Ultimate cover, fitting and quality is perfectüëç Go for it for inspiron 15 5510"
5,Fit perfectly.
5,Very Good Product and Quality
5,"Keys are soft and don't require too much effort to press. Keys are quiet too, no clack-clacks. Keyboard itself is wide and not cramped. Has a full separate number pad and full sized backspace key as well which are all very important for daily usage. A total steal at this price"
5,I started using Zebronics Zeb-Glide wired keyboard and realy impressed with this brand.The keys are soft and multifunctional purpose helps to toggle and provides asier user access.It has multimedia shortcut keys as well to provide immense experience during binge watching.Good design and product quality with durable wired USB.Must recommend for smooth user experience.Worth every penny!
5,"There isn't much of travel in the keys thus won't recommend for gaming, but it's good at everything else. Recommend to buy. Value for money."
5,"I came across this keyboard at my friends house and found it to be very elegant and beautiful in appearance, easy to type on. In particular, the tactile responsiveness is perfect in giving a firm lightness to typing. Destined to be a classic."
5,I really like this keyboard. Keyboard is very light weighted and working very smoothly. I recommend this product. Customers can just go for this product. I am really satisfied with it. Thank u
5,Thought to save my lappy keyboard as kids are playing games on the laptop. This keyboard came as a savior and I would say this is really good keyboard and keys are really soft while typing.
5,"Exactly what I wanted. Works smoothly. The keys are smooth to the touch. These are a bit small, but that's OK. Overall, worth the price, value for money."
5,Good for theprice
5,Good built. Smooth keys. Indian rupee key is made available. Good product in given price. I think it will long last. Though price is cheap but quality is better
5,"This keyboard is awesome!I wanted a keyboard that had ‚Äúlow-travel‚Äù and smooth keys.This keyboard has it all. The keys take less pressure to press it which makes up for a comfortable typing experience. Also, it looks pretty sweet in this white color!All in all it‚Äôs a great keyboard and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find a better option at this price. 10/10 recommended."
5,"After using many keyboards over the years, I found this most comfortable and best ergonomic keyboard. It is joy to type on this key board for long hours and long time. Good for programmers as well as those people who type all the times !"
5,"I was looking for compact keyboard with normal key size for letters, most of the compact keyboards won't satisfy this because the keyboard would be compact however the keysize would be small and quality of the keyboard also is worse. But this one is nice and smooth, compact able to place next to mouse in the keyboard area. One minor issue is with some of the keys are small in this keyboard, which you would press instead of the required"
5,"This is the best Keyboard for Typing. Being a Content Writer, I use to do typing for more than 6 hours a day and this Zebronics Keyboard is the best companion for me. This is the best keyboard for Stenographers at this price. Really worth it."
5,FULLY SATISFIED....DON'T READ NEGATIVE COMMENTS LIKE ME JUST GO FOR IT IF YOU NEED A KEYBOARD FOR YOUR PC/ LAPTOP
5,Am 1sttime purchase electronics products from Amazon.. I am really happyfor value for money and comfort and softness keyboard.. also sealpack product received ... Original Zebronics keyboard .
5,"As always Zeb products, great one with great performance, regular use, coding, heavy use, fine for allMust buy product"
1,"Disappointed that i took this product. ,Very small in size and does not match what you see in the pic. Keys are so closely placed and up/down arrows almost overlap with other keys, so much that you need practice yourself to use it without pressing another key."
5,Using it as external keyboard for work and kids online classes. Easily operatable with soft keys. Saves the keys on laptop's keyboard from rough usage by kids. I do not intend to use it for gaming.
3,"It's good keyboard , but not for fast typing and it's too compact. It is not as sturdy as it looks in the picture. I would not suggest this for someone who has to type a lot."

5,world class experince with this keyboard but i never used this keyboard.But iam still recommending this keyboard idont know why

5,"Best in the range. Using it on a regular basis for work as well as gaming, great performance and a smart buy."
5,Its not quite value for money since it costs me ‚Çπ380 but anyways it perfectly fitted my new Asus rog 2021 laptop and also there aren't much options for Asus Rog 2021keyboard cover since its launched recently.

1,"The reason why I have to work more in this WFH, is this keyboard. every time when I type anything on this keyboard it misses many letters. and soon after writing the long comments, I realize many words are incomplete or type incompletely/incorrectly.My personal opinion is to look for some other better options or go with a wired keyboard. I can't comment in there exists such an issue with every wireless keyboard or specifically with my model.Other worst thing happened to me is that I contacted Amazon on the day when the replacement window got closed.But what can I do, on that day I realized it was something that is happening very frequently and I can't work like this. First they said they will help me get it replaced as I am a valuable customer and later on contacting them back they started explaining me their policies.I this time I can't even visit service center, and even if I do then no guarantee they will get it done asap.So better buy any other product based on my experience with it.Thanks...."
1,"Actually i don't like to Write negative feedback for any  product unless the product was fault or not worthy,And this Product With name brand lenovo but i'm not sure its Original,5 months only used this - 12 batteries replaced, okay i adjust that and used,And now Mouse Scroll not Working, its going to trash hereafter,This is BIGSCAM in eCommerce, it has Serial Number Informations, i tried to check with Lenovo website but the device didn't recognised,Cheap Product, Only Buy If its come with 600-700rs. offer, Don't waste your money!!Believe me, You regret it! Definitely its not worth your 1400rs."
5,"Here's my detailed product review (also testing out the keyboard as I type this!).Delivery from Amazon took less than 24 hours. Although the product comes in a see through packaging from Amazon so the original Lenovo carton is visible when you receive the product. Nothing that one should be worried about though.The keyboard:The keyboard is adequately sized. The key spacing is perfect to my linking and typing on it feels very smooth with no clicking sound from the keys. It features three LED indicators for caps lock, num lock and what appears to be a low battery indicator. Keep in mind though that the indicators don't stay on - they go off after a few seconds so it is difficult to tell if the caps/num lock key is ON by looking at the indicators. They do however clearly indicate that the key was pressed or released. Not really a pain point. The keyboard uses a single AAA cell that comes in the box. The physical appearance of the keyboard is alright - nothing very fancy. The keys have a frosted ""top"" with white lettering and the key edges have a glossy black finish. Stand out feature- it has a volume control keys on the top row!!The mouse:I have been using the Logitech m235 wireless mouse for the last two years and have grown used to it so the one thing that I notice with this mouse is the speed. I have had to bump up the mouse pointer speed setting under windows  to the maximum with almost any mouse that I have used. For this one I feel I may have to lower that setting. Having said that the precision and accuracy is really good for my work (I don't do any graphic/CAD design though so I wouldn't know if this suits those requirements). It runs off a AA battery that comes in the box and has a recess underneath to house the USB receiver in whenever you're not using it. It is also provided with an ON/OFF slider switch. Compared to the keyboard I find that the appearance of the mouse is better than the keyboard's with a neat glossy black trim wrapping around the mouse with matt black finish on top with the Lenovo branding.Bottom line: If you're looking for a basic wireless keyboard and mouse, you should go for it . Even without being a full multimedia keyboard it has Volume control keys that is a real plus point. I got it from Cloudtail for 999 as a lightning deal."
4,"Value of Money, Good Product, if you use key board for any android device, first change settings under key board, and set remote key board then only your enter key word else while pressing enter key it reflect 'q'. overall nice deal, fast delivery from amazon got @ 850/- under lightning deal with 15% cash back."
2,"I Purchased this product because reviews showed me that the product have light indicator when the caps lock key is turned on or off, but this is not complete reality when you press caps lock key, light is blinked only one time to indicate that caps lock is on, it is not turned on till you press the caps lock key again like other keyboard.Because of which it becomes difficult to use MS Word, Excel etc where it is commonly used."
5,Awosme product. I m very happy to get this product
1,"Product box was not sealed, also the box was broken as if it was used previously.Important point is, this product has only one year warranty as per warranty card but seller has mentioned 3 year warranty.Keyboard keys quality is not good, keys are very delicate looks like it can be easily broken. Num lock and caps lock light doesn't remains on when keys are active hence difficult to guess if keys are pressed.Mouse quality is good."
5,"After lot of research I ended up purchasing this combo. Both keyboard and mouse are working seamlessly. Keyboard typing is comfortable. The led indicators on keyboard is tiny though and does not stay lit always, i.e. once activated, it blinks for couple of time and goes away but that's fine, atleast you will get the indicators while most other brand does not have indicators for all options. No lag while typing. Mouse is super smooth. Clicks and scrolls are both very good."
1,"Product looks good,Fast delivery.Keyboard & Mouse paired very fast.Mouse work fine, but Keyboard is not working properly.In Keyboard CAPS & NUM lock LED indicator are not staying, when you press button, LED comes & goes off immediately, due this You cannot know whether CAPS & NUM lock ON/OFF.I returned & replaced the product, still the same issue continues.If this is expected functionality of the Product, then it's very bad product design."
2,"The mouse is working. There is a power problem with the keyboard. Sometimes it is working fine, sometimes not. When not working, I simply rotate the battery in connected position, then it works.Numlock indicator supposed to be lighted continously. When it is pressed, indicator blinks for about five seconds, then go off.Suggest me what to do."
1,"Do not purchase!This is the second set we have got, as in the first set, mouse was faulty. At start, the set worked fine. Next week there was major lag between the Keyboard, the mouse & the receiver. We thought it was the battery so we changed it. It ran fine then again the same problem persists. We thought the battery was bad so we changed it again. But then again the problem persists. I understand i'm out of return policy or refund & don't mind the cost, but the set is bad & shame o n Amazon & Appario to sell me this equipment. Do not purchase!"
3,"Writing a review after using the product for a week.Well, it is great to be honest. Does what it is intended for. The mouse is good. I am very particular about the grip and sensitivity of the mouse. I have used many wireless mouses and not all of them are good. This mouse may well be used for gaming as well (better than average but not exactly comparing with core gaming mouse)They keyboard is a bit of a let down. The range is weak. It loses connectivity if the adapter is not in sight.I am using it on my mac."
1,"I was expecting a cheap keyboard but not so cheap. Keypads are stiff and typing a sentence can take ages even for experts. It will not last more than year I‚Äôm sure if used more than 5-6 hours a day.. keyboard and the keypad is very compact and has nice design .. but what‚Äôs the point when one has to struggle to type. I may end up throwing or donating it away to someone. I sincerely request people not to buy this model, spend some more money to save all the money on other product. If one does have too much of work then may think of buying. Quality is very cheap."
5,"The keys are not very plasticky and has a quite a bit of travel as one would prefer from a desk keyboard. The keys are soft and pretty responsive.The mouse on the other hand is a bit too light, which I am not very fond of, but is very responsive and smooth. The buttons provide a good feel and overall the build quality is satisfactory.Coming to the battery life, it‚Äôs running for over two months now, without any problems and the claims by Lenovo  on battery are yet to be justified.The keyboard cannot be turned off, there is no switch for that, but the mouse has a switch to turn it off or on. I haven‚Äôt turned off any of the devices yet from the time I bought it, and I use it around 9/10 hours everyday with the new work from home norm. The battery is holding up pretty good till now."
1,"Keyboard misses several signals. Cannot type fast. One has to be very slow. At times, it just hangs and one has to wait several seconds, before continue to type. Sent a message to Lenovo Customer Care, but no response.I have tried on 2 laptops, one being brand new.Laptop is placed just one feet away and receiver is plugged directly into laptop. Tried changing battery also."
1,Keyboard is hard and stiff. Not at all easy to use. Unfortunately this happened a month after purchase I.e. after the window for returning the item has closed so basically there's nothing one can do but grin and bare or throw the keyboard out. Sucks!
1,"Everything was all good, worked well initially, layout, feel, etc. all suited me. BUT then, suddenly I started noticing missing key strokes. I thought it is battery problem, changed its battery to new Duracell Ultra but then also it didn't worked.This problem is making this key board unusable. It is in warranty but don't know whether they will accept this or not plus running to service center during this pandemic time is also not a good option. So, within 1 month my money is wasted and now nothing but an e-waste."
4,Awesome keyboard. Right size. Best thing it has single usb connector for both wireless mouse and keyboard so saving another usb port for other usage.Keys are a litte hard and not very soft but i think it will get soft with usage.Happy with the product. I got it forRs 1190. Review on 1st day. But since it has warranty i m not much worried.
2,"This keyboard results in erratic keystroke capture. It seems to be completely whimsical working perfectly sometimes and not at other times.I sit away from the laptop (about 8 feet away). Did not face this issues with my earlier keyboards.This can be quite irritating when you are typing more to only realise later that letters are missing.The other issue I see is that the Caps lock and num lock light dont stay on.So not sure how this feature helps, especially Caps lock. The light simply blinks and turns off.I started to type this review as the keyboard again gave me a problem with all keystrokes not being captured.Funnily, while I typed this review, it worked flawlessly."
5,This product is good and easy to use and lightweight. You can use this product for typing fast and also having a good feeling that we are using on PC. Nive and quality product.
2,"The product looks beautiful and sleek. The keys are large and needs a little bit to get used to. My main problem was that there were a lot of missed keystrokes. It's not just when you are typing fast, you have to type really slow to register all keystrokes. I have used a logitech wireless keyboard + mouse combo and faced no such problems. Disappointed in this product as lenovo is a trusted brand. The mouse works great though."
1,"After 6 months of use, 8 times out of 10 the keys are completely unresponsive, changed to new batteries but didn‚Äôt help, the keyboard is never more than 6 feet away from the receptor, be it gaming or watchin movies it‚Äôs frustrating at times, the left click on the mouse gives away too easily, had to change the settings n now using the right click, no durability or longevity."
4,"It's not for gamers, as it feels a little delicate for that but for someone who has to type a lot. It's not heavy at all, I can take it in my lap and type all day long. Quite easy to use. It's sleek, simple and smart just what I was looking for. A perfect no nonsense keyboard and mouse combo that means business. The only let down that I felt is build quality, it could have been a little stardy, keyboard feels a little fragile apart from that it's maska.... Thanks lenovo, thanks amazon..."
3,"Perhaps due to typing on another keyboard, I am having difficulty typing but I am trying to change my habit of hitting hard on keys. Backspace and enter keys give troubleOtherwise, with light strokes, it works fine. It is a minimalistic design and perhaps the cheapest keyboard mouse combo of Lenovo.I Will take time to comment correctly"
5,"Recommended. However be informed, that the power in the mouse doesn't switch off automatically, when the computer is switched off. Should be manually switched off. Even cheaper mouse, from Portronics, i- Bell switches off automatically if left unused , and starts automatically when booting. Keyboard might have the same defect, but I didn't check that out till now."
2,"Just after 4 months of usage, the keyboard became unresponsive to the keypresses - it just did not recognize the keys being pressed.. So I replaced the battery (i used a fresh DURACELL AAA battery) on the Keyboard and then for about 2 days, it was a little better (though at times it still did not recognize some key presses)..Same issue I faced with the Mouse piece as well.. it became unresponsive after maybe 7 months of usage.. Changing the battery on the mouse piece, it was back to normal..Lesson learnt: stick to the company who has been manufacturing keyboards for a long time now like Logitech or Microsoft or Dell (maybe even HP).."
1,"Item was delivered on Delivered 31-Mar-2021, Return window closed on 07-Apr-2021. Worked great in two weeks, now keyboard is not responding when I press keys. I have to press it multiple time to get response. I can't even return this item, my money is wasted. This is really bad item, didn't expect this from brand like 'Lenovo'. I would recommend you to buy some other keyboard, even mouse performance is below satisfaction level. Buy it at your own risk."
3,"The quality of the product is really nice. The only issue with the product is that the keys have become hard to use and it becomes really annoying if you type fast. You have to keep going back to correct the words.Mouse is very smooth and doing a good job so far.Also, the keyboard is well covered while not in use.."
1,Situation Rport - 1 Month of usage - Cannot go too far away from the dongle - A lot of typed letters missing from output ( This reviw was made with this product...) - Buttons are getting soft and flimsy - Not fun to type!Regrtting the purchase. Assumd that Lenovo would sell reliable and useful products... Apparently NOT! :(
3,"The keyboard build quality is good, keypress and ergonomics are good. The only problem with this is that it consume the battery too soon, I've to replace the battery in 1-2 weeks.Due to the problem sometimes it misses the keypress. Try to buy a keyboard with switch to turn it on and off. If you've budget only in this price then its a good product, but you have to pull out the battery when not in use.The mouse is good and have the switch to turn it off and on."
5,"This is such a nice product. I was skeptical choosing the green colour, but it turned out to be even better than the pictures. I am using it with my Macbook Pro and connecting it was seamless. Mac will ask your help to setup this keyboard and once done, you can use it like a normal keyboard. The Windows button on this keyboard will be mapped to the Command key of the mac.In terms of design & aesthetics, it's just stunning. The keystrokes are lovely, there is good enough sound (not too loud) and the overall experience is very good. I type a lot and it doesn't hurt my hands after long typing sessions. You can remove the keys and clean them. It's a beautiful mech keyboard. If you want something different which will not be primarily for gaming, this is your thing. The mouse is good as well, nothing special though.Overall, highly recommend."
5,"I've wanted a fancy mechanical keyboard for so long. This one works just fine. The keys sound amazing. The colors are so pretty in real. The photos couldn't do justice. I actually wanted blue & green versions of this keyboard too but settled on this one cuz they look like yummy candies. Enough about the looks, this actually works pretty well. The mouse is perfectly sized and snug in your hands. It was a bit fast in the start but then I adjusted the settings in my laptop now it works just like how I wanted it to. The keys are a bit closely set together but you'll eventually get used to it. I mean this is my third day and (I write a hell lot of essays) I'm already used to it. I play a decent amount of RPG games too and I love using this keyboard for light gaming. One suggestion I have for the manufacturers is about the indicator lights.  They are placed on the slope of the rounded edge of the keyboard and I can't really sometimes see if the caps lock is on or not. But that's just a minor issue. Really love this product and highly recommend it. If i find anything I don't like about it in the future I will update the review.p.s forgive my lq grainy pics."
1,"Hi,Here I will try to type my feedback with this keyboard, with my regular typing speed. You may guess how busy the keys are in the keyboard.Very cluttered, here is the typing without correcting them:I was impress witgh the desigbn abd thought it could be a very good kjeytboard for mne, but aftewr getting it, I am trying to type with my regular spoeed anbd you can judge ghow vbad the key arrangements are in this keyboiard.The same pareagraph if I type with my old keytbopard, I will not have these many mistakes for suyre. as the keys are well arranfged there.overall, not happy with the keyboard. also overpriced.Thanks,"
5,"I ordered this keyboard because I was in great need of one. It‚Äôs pretty cute and the colours fit perfectly with each other. The green colour scheme coupled with a few white ones make the mechanical key caps pop! It‚Äôs very satisfying to type on and if you‚Äôre looking for a mechanical keyboard with a spunky colour scheme as well as an aesthetic piece of hardware for your computer, go for it. This is the cheapest keyboard (of great quality) available on the market today and I loved this product so much that I simply had to write a review. It‚Äôs a one time investment that‚Äôll last seemingly forever if you look after it and works on batteries which are replaceable.GO FOR IT!!"
4,"Nice product, delivered as described.Cons -1. It takes sometime getting used to this, and you are bound to make some typos in the meantime.2. It does make some sound when you type, almost like a typewriter. So if your work involves too much typing, it might start to bother you over the time.3. Function key is on the right side of the space bar. Page Up and Down and Home and End keys overlap with the arrow keys. So bothers me a lot to be able to use this combination.Pros -1. Very quirky, unique and eye-catching.2. Fun to use3. The keys feel sturdy and should last long4. Mouse is good too. Needed to be a little bigger thoughOverall quite pleased with the product, wish it was little less expensive though. They should also have an option to order it without mouse, coz not everyone needs one."
4,"It's a nice looking keyboard with good build quality. One issue is since it has round keys as compared to square that we are generally accustomed of, it takes time to adjust and very often it leads to mistypes.Mouse is also quite ergonomic and respond nicely on any surface"
4,"I was seeing these types of keyboards all over the internet mainly on channels of abroad youtubers and i really wanted to try the retro typewriter style keyboard and i came across this. I absolutely loved it and its very smooth and aesthetic  in work. One thing that i would like to say to the other customers is that the cells in the keyboard is packed so you have to unpack then and then place them to make it work. And when bot in use for a couple of hours, pull out the usb drive and keep it back at its place. I struggled a little at the start because i didnt know the cells were packed. Anyways, hope this review helps you!"
4,"If you're planning to buy this considering it has mechanical keys type , then it's strict no no . Otherwise the product looks good in terms of appearance. The letters are printed without proper alignment. It's a little bulky-feel keyboard with thick round edges. Overall It does justice to the retro keyboard style."
5,"Cool product, better than regular keybrds. Although the blue one looks like green one to me. I think its a must have for whosoever wants a wireless keybrd and mouse. All keys and mouse also is very comfortable and very smooth to operate. Comes with batteries also. This piece is a design innovation and worthy of an award."
5,"After using for a month, find no issue. Keys are smooth green color looks cool then the traditional black. Product finishing and material gives a good look. Circular keys gives a cool look. I waited for this 20days and really satisfied."
5,"The product I received was in very good condition. Packaging is also great. The batteries come pre installed but make sure to remove the plastic covering from the batteries. It's easy to set up, just plug in and you are good to go. The quality of keys also feels nice and damp."
4,Look wise it's a beauty. It's truly a novelty item. You will take some time to operate it as comfortable as your old keyboard. Function wise there is a room for improvement. Missing the mechanical sound experience. Mouse is bit big in size which makes it less convenient.
3,Look wise performance it was good. But only for hime purposes. For IT Employees not that much efficient. Keys are like type writer keys. Fast typing is not possible.
1,"Its hard to type, though the keys are smooth .. but have to press deeperand possibility of pressing wrong key is very frequent.I don't recommend this keyboard for a person who's job needs continuos typing thoughout the day.Looks pretty, material is good but NOT Recommended :(Couldn't use more than a week."
5,What a astonishing keyboard. It feels premium while using it. The keypress doesn't even make sound and trying is very smooth. My typing speed is faster as I don't look at keyboard while typing and this keyboard doing excellent jon since day one. Highly recommended.
5,"Edit after a month usage -The keyboard were good but now I feel they are not that great as it was once new.The keys feel stuck while typing.Old:I did a lot of research to buy the best keyboard for Office and Casual Gaming like CSGO etc.I had used multiple keyboards(Dell wireless, Logitech) including Logitech MX keyboards which is priced around 13k.The Build quality, smooth keyboard surface, and Chiclet sound key typing experience are same compared to Logitech MX, the best things is the price, which is obsoletely un believable  for such build quality.If you are looking minimal key travel like MAC BOOK PRO or ANY Lenovo/Dell Laptop kind of experience I would gladly inform you to go to a head without any further Research. which is a GEM for this price.I hope this helps some one."
5,"Consider me a worker who doesn't wanna annoy ppl around me with loud and noisy keyboard clicks. After returning multiple keyboards which were to work silent didn‚Äôt do so, i chose  K4000M and now i would say with full hope on the brand, this is the chosen one. Overall silent operation with the keys, just pushing your fingers out once it clicks on it. Feather-like feel and no noise at all. Apart from this, the printing on keys looks good quality and the USB is so quick it reads the keyboard very fast."
5,"Generally this k4000m device is a slim thin form factor model. I will consider this as a good choice for professionals in typing. Silent usage and no issues with the typing and USB connectivity of the keyboard. I read that the keys are chiclet and laser printed, both doing a good job, just best at their part. Almost 2 meter cable with thick outer braids, integrated multimedia is real help when you want to save time. Best buy after an overall usage review."
5,"Simple and well structured design for a full sized keyboard. The key spacing is exact without much gaps, the fingers are well reachable. Braided cable looks and feels rigid, with a well mouled USB connector. Key press feel with the chiclet feel is real add on value, soft on finger tips. Easy connectivity with your PC or Laptop directly without USB hubs, coz the cable is of 2 mtrs. Approx. Multimedia keys are of good use, helpful at times. 5star rated keyboard for sure."
5,"Quick review for looking out to buy soft feel keyboards, this one is a gem. Zebronics IT goods are famous for ages, this one's a keeper of it. Light feel, good design and the blackness of the keyboard is so eye-catching. Multimedia controls, Braided cable and chiclet keys all features set the bar high by this keyboard. No clicking noise trouble, comfortable without finger fatigue and design is flaw free, with a pretty long braided cable."
4,Keys are good and don't make much noise but they are not exactly like laptop chiclet keyboard.
3,"not as expected , keys need to press deep  not soft as laptop keys , overall its ok"
2,"Feel wise, it's a great keyboard. Silent too as compared to my Dell ones. Was doing great the first 2 months. However now the backspace and tab keys get stuck repeatedly. Mine is a low dust clean home work environment. By stuck here i mean i have to physically pull the stuck key out."
3,"Its alphanumeric keys are very silent and give a premium experience while typing but it shift key, space bar, enter key,+ key all these make a bit of noise like a normal keyboard which doesn't completely meet the requirement for which i purchased it. And its Volume buttons are not working at all.I have also done replacement but volume keys doesn't work. But its not a bit problem bcoz i use it very rarely.I purchased it yesterday at a price of 749 from the Great Indian Festival sale. Price dropped to 700 in 15 days during diwali sale."
5,"very soft, light and soundless keyboard, very good for WFH esp. if working till late night, it will not disturb the others at home."
1,The Product disconnects every often and stops working in between. Makes the system disconnect noise. Start experiencing the issue after 10 days so unable to replace.
1,Ok product not good for everyone. Specially space key is very uncomfortable while typing.
5,"the keyboard is really good, soft keyboard and silent , efficient to use .. so far so good!"
1,"the ""W"" key gets stuck, and I have to pull it out manually.Also, the typing experience is not good enough."
1,Keys started to get stuck just after the return window expired. Wouldn't recommend anyone to go for this product.
1,"after 7 days some of key not working, after press it was not functioning, not a good product."
5,Good

Very quirky, unique and eye-catching.2. Fun to use3. The keys feel sturdy and should last long4. Mouse is good too. Needed to be a little bigger thoughOverall quite pleased with the product, wish it was little less expensive though. They should also have an option to order it without mouse, coz not everyone needs one."
4,"It's a nice looking keyboard with good build quality. One issue is since it has round keys as compared to square that we are generally accustomed of, it takes time to adjust and very often it leads to mistypes.Mouse is also quite ergonomic and respond nicely on any surface"
4,"I was seeing these types of keyboards all over the internet mainly on channels of abroad youtubers and i really wanted to try the retro typewriter style keyboard and i came across this. I absolutely loved it and its very smooth and aesthetic  in work. One thing that i would like to say to the other customers is that the cells in the keyboard is packed so you have to unpack then and then place them to make it work. And when bot in use for a couple of hours, pull out the usb drive and keep it back at its place. I struggled a little at the start because i didnt know the cells were packed. Anyways, hope this review helps you!"
4,"If you're planning to buy this considering it has mechanical keys type , then it's strict no no . Otherwise the product looks good in terms of appearance. The letters are printed without proper alignment. It's a little bulky-feel keyboard with thick round edges. Overall It does justice to the retro keyboard style."
5,"Cool product, better than regular keybrds. Although the blue one looks like green one to me. I think its a must have for whosoever wants a wireless keybrd and mouse. All keys and mouse also is very comfortable and very smooth to operate. Comes with batteries also. This piece is a design innovation and worthy of an award."
5,"After using for a month, find no issue. Keys are smooth green color looks cool then the traditional black. Product finishing and material gives a good look. Circular keys gives a cool look. I waited for this 20days and really satisfied."
5,"The product I received was in very good condition. Packaging is also great. The batteries come pre installed but make sure to remove the plastic covering from the batteries. It's easy to set up, just plug in and you are good to go. The quality of keys also feels nice and damp."
4,Look wise it's a beauty. It's truly a novelty item. You will take some time to operate it as comfortable as your old keyboard. Function wise there is a room for improvement. Missing the mechanical sound experience. Mouse is bit big in size which makes it less convenient.
3,Look wise performance it was good. But only for hime purposes. For IT Employees not that much efficient. Keys are like type writer keys. Fast typing is not possible.
1,"Its hard to type, though the keys are smooth .. but have to press deeperand possibility of pressing wrong key is very frequent.I don't recommend this keyboard for a person who's job needs continuos typing thoughout the day.Looks pretty, material is good but NOT Recommended :(Couldn't use more than a week."
5,"This is such a nice product. I was skeptical choosing the green colour, but it turned out to be even better than the pictures. I am using it with my Macbook Pro and connecting it was seamless. Mac will ask your help to setup this keyboard and once done, you can use it like a normal keyboard. The Windows button on this keyboard will be mapped to the Command key of the mac.In terms of design & aesthetics, it's just stunning. The keystrokes are lovely, there is good enough sound (not too loud) and the overall experience is very good. I type a lot and it doesn't hurt my hands after long typing sessions. You can remove the keys and clean them. It's a beautiful mech keyboard. If you want something different which will not be primarily for gaming, this is your thing. The mouse is good as well, nothing special though.Overall, highly recommend."
5,"I've wanted a fancy mechanical keyboard for so long. This one works just fine. The keys sound amazing. The colors are so pretty in real. The photos couldn't do justice. I actually wanted blue & green versions of this keyboard too but settled on this one cuz they look like yummy candies. Enough about the looks, this actually works pretty well. The mouse is perfectly sized and snug in your hands. It was a bit fast in the start but then I adjusted the settings in my laptop now it works just like how I wanted it to. The keys are a bit closely set together but you'll eventually get used to it. I mean this is my third day and (I write a hell lot of essays) I'm already used to it. I play a decent amount of RPG games too and I love using this keyboard for light gaming. One suggestion I have for the manufacturers is about the indicator lights.  They are placed on the slope of the rounded edge of the keyboard and I can't really sometimes see if the caps lock is on or not. But that's just a minor issue. Really love this product and highly recommend it. If i find anything I don't like about it in the future I will update the review.p.s forgive my lq grainy pics."
1,"Hi,Here I will try to type my feedback with this keyboard, with my regular typing speed. You may guess how busy the keys are in the keyboard.Very cluttered, here is the typing without correcting them:I was impress witgh the desigbn abd thought it could be a very good kjeytboard for mne, but aftewr getting it, I am trying to type with my regular spoeed anbd you can judge ghow vbad the key arrangements are in this keyboiard.The same pareagraph if I type with my old keytbopard, I will not have these many mistakes for suyre. as the keys are well arranfged there.overall, not happy with the keyboard. also overpriced.Thanks,"
5,"I ordered this keyboard because I was in great need of one. It‚Äôs pretty cute and the colours fit perfectly with each other. The green colour scheme coupled with a few white ones make the mechanical key caps pop! It‚Äôs very satisfying to type on and if you‚Äôre looking for a mechanical keyboard with a spunky colour scheme as well as an aesthetic piece of hardware for your computer, go for it. This is the cheapest keyboard (of great quality) available on the market today and I loved this product so much that I simply had to write a review. It‚Äôs a one time investment that‚Äôll last seemingly forever if you look after it and works on batteries which are replaceable.GO FOR IT!!"
4,"Nice product, delivered as described.Cons -1. It takes sometime getting used to this, and you are bound to make some typos in the meantime.2.

5,I was looking for a budget keyboard with RGB backlight to step up my setup and then I came across this product. In my view this keyboard is very close to perfect (for the price).PROS-1.Highly customisable RGB lighting which no other keyboard offers at this price range!2.Good click feeling..even though not mechanical.3.Long braided usb cable.CONS-1.Keyboard should have been working raised at angle to make it more ergonomic.2.The red back looks really cheap!CONCLUSIONI would definitely recommend this keyboard
5,First of all to cosmic byte plese make specific area to get reviews  in Amazon all of keyboards reviews are mixed up..And to you who is reading cb gk 02 corona is a great keyboard with engraved letters and good rgb for price..If you don't have budget to buy more than 1200 then this keyboard is for you.And if you are buying this for traveling plese don't this keyboard could  break under 5-10kg load so take one cheap keyboard which is unbrekble..
5,"The keyboard is certainly good looking and as shown in th images.Pros: Bright lit and readable keys.-Accurate key stroke are registered-I would say when it comes to gaming this is at par with some of the expensive keyboards.- Multi Color LEDs with 9 preset modes- Braided cables which is a only available on premium keyboard. It's a mark of a quality keyboard.Cons: No arm rest which makes it a pain to use this for longer hours.- The Led modes are preset and they cannot be saved so each time you turn on your PC you have to select your previously set mode again.- Prone to collecting lot of dirt as there is log of gap between the keys.But despite the cons I love the keyboard. It's one sturdy keyboard. If you are on a budget, but want to have a premium keyboard experience then go for this one."
3,"My cousin bought this keyboard and i tested his out its RGB colors look very pretty and was convinced to buy it, but when it arrived the box was damaged and when i saw the keyboard, it was opening even though the screws were there, had it replaced and even the replaced version of the keyboard was damaged, this shows how well they handle the package, i'm returning the product as of now, guys if you want to buy this keyboard I recommend to buy it on their website which is cosmic byte, the guys in amazon do not know how to handle the product, this is the first time i've had a bad experience with amazon through may years as being a regular customer."
4,"this is just an attempt to find out what typing on this thing feels like.The tactile feedback is pretty good, however the end is a bit soft. So it's good-bad.The overall feel of typing is pretty good though.The keys aren't too hard to press, they are spaced well enough.The shape of the enter key is a bit different from what I'm habituated to, but that's not an issue.The backlighting is pretty good. It comes with a direct on-off switch, and has 3 levels of intensity adjustment.Note: this is a blue LED only model. The direct LED on-off key is very handy instead of having to toggle through the settings.The risers on the bottom aren't too tall, so they don't give the keyboard much of an angle.Overall, it's a very good keyboard, but not one particularly aimed at gamers.It's essentially just a normal keyboard with some backlit keys."
3,"The keyboard is good and all, but the keys won't last very long... Its a membrane keyboard, so the keys will get softer as time passes. But after lightly using it for around a month, the keys are already very soft... If you like soft keyboards then you may not face a problem. But for those who like tactile keyboards, just get a mechanical keyboard or get a different membrane keyboard. This keyboard is good for typing, but not good for gaming.."

4,"It's not bad for the price. I got it for 1099 but would have been a better purchase under 1000.My ObservationsBuilt quality is goodLooks beautiful and elegantKeys and spacing is goodRGB light doesn't change color. It lights up in 4 fixed color from one side to the otherüü¢üî¥üü£üîµSo the characters on the keypad also appear in the same color.Backlight is dimmable in 3 levels and you can also turn it off.Only 1 Fixed durarion breathable mode no other effectLED under the membrane is visible, the light isn't spread evenly.LED under the last row/space key is slightly irritating.It looks elegant without backlight but then the characters are slightly difficult to read.In dark rooms you can easily use it.Grip at the bottom is good and riders are broad making it much stable. Gives a very good typing angle for hands.Can't really comment on typing experience, will get used to it after using for 2-3 weeks.Overall not a bad choice, looks and feels better than other so called gaming keyboards in the same price range.If you are not bad hardcore gamer and want a decent multipurpose keyboard at affordable price then go for it."
4,"(After 3 months use)Bought at Rs.1,065. Good performance.Pros:1. Good brightness of RGB light.2. Sturdy quality of metal frame.3. Anti-ghosting pretty good.Cons:1. Only normal and breathing mode in back-light.2. Numeric keys don't have anti ghosting so skill moves difficult in FIFA.3. Spacebar sometimes makes squeaky sound"
5,"it's a pretty good keyboard. It feels smooth, I like typing on it, and it's much smaller than my previous keyboard which means I have more area on my desk. Happy with my purchase!"
5,For this price ..thus keyboard is excellent. You never get it like this keyboard even with higher prices.there is a problem in space bar and enter key in the middle.other than that an wonderful product from evofox...please go for it üòÄüòâüëç
4,I like it but I have given 4 stars because it have only one effect in RGB if there are other effects also then it will be the best keyboard among this price range but if you need performance you should go with this üëç
4,this is best keyboard ever i get in under 1000 metal body and litewaight with brided cable reviewing after 1 month of use go for it
5,This keyboard is pretty sweet. Looks and works great. The lights look awesome and it allows me to work with the light off. Works great for gaming or just typing.
5,Whenever you press space bar there's a squeaking sound.It's really annoying but the keyboard is worth it for 1000rs. It's built quality is good. It's good for this budget.
5,Gives the kids their fun factor... Lovely colourful back light lights....
4,"After just 4 months of use, some of the keys stopped working, I have contacted support and got the issue fixed, but it took 2weeks."
5,1:very good rgb2:some parts the lights are not showing3:very good product for 999 rupees4:It does not have a software5:nice keyboard sounds very satisfied6:I'm typing with this keyboard7:overall 5 rate :) notice keyboard
5,"Very good keyboard, the keys aren't sticky like my last keyboard so that's good for gamingLove the light effect, makes writing and gaming in the dark much easier, I also like that you can turn off the LED"
5,"It doesn't have to customize colors, but other than that it's an absolutely cool silent keyboard. Good quality for how cheap it was. Haven't had any issues and I've had it now for a month."
3,"the switches can be more soft, i give it three starts, it is okay that is it"
4,if your room is dusty than dont buy this bcoz this will not work properly bcoz it have floting key anyway it is decent for gaming and it have bright backlight
5,"The keyboard is great at the price point also I love it built quality, and design of RGB light  ,  so I recommend every gamers to go for it without thinking anything."
4,respone is very good üòçand i will its a value for moneythanku
5,This is a good keyboard for touch typists and also gamers.Very comfortable experience.I will say don't think too much just go for it.
1,"One key was malfuntioning when it came, returned it instantly."
5,this mini keyboard is extremely useful for my work. it's amazing and extremely compact
5,This is a Very Good Products
5,"Pros:1) Ultra thin silicone material that protects your keys from water splashes and dust.2) Sticks well without any adhesive, it's a perfect fit for my Macbook Air m1.3) Does not dim the backlit keyboard so you can use this at night as well in dark rooms.Cons:It's a 500 bucks keyboard protector, ismai bhi cons dhoond rahe ho :pNone that I found."
4,"On the plus side, it's thin, flexible, and fits the M1 MacBook Air 2020 perfectly.However, it reduces the contrast and effectiveness of the backlighting, and you have to type a little harder. Having had keyboards damaged by water splashes on two previous MacBooks, I'm willing to put up with these two minor issues, rather than coughing up Rs 20,000 because two keys don't work.That said, this cover does not provide adequate protection around the perimeter of the keyboard - you still need to be careful"
5,"If you live in a dusty city like Mumbai, I feel this is a must have product. The cut is PERFECT, you‚Äôll only see slight bumps in 1-2 spots, which is totally fair. Can I type with this on? I type lightning fast and key feedback is critical to me, so what I do is take it off when I have to type a lot. I don‚Äôt want to criticize the cover for not giving me the same feedback as an actual Mac keyboard. I put the cover back when I‚Äôm using it with photoshop, or browsing. Ever since I got it, my keyboard has been squeaky clean. People are complaining about the price but being aware of how rare accessories are in India, I‚Äôm just glad that someone is at least selling these. For 150-200 you will get poor products. Why do people want poor products? Let‚Äôs get the good stuff and use it for a while. Even if it protects my Mac for 6 months, I‚Äôm more than happy."
4,"It is ok product, when it comes to covering keyboard. it dosent fit perfectly, so when you type you can feel cover above your keyboard is moving vertically. Horizontally it fits perfectly, vertically all key shapes are slightly bigger than actual keys.I am using this with MacBook Air with M1.Worst part about this product is, it's Made in China."
4,"The overall product quality is great, I'm satisfied with the purchase.Pros:*Thin and soft*Fit's perfect*F and J key indicators.*Almost feels like invisibleCons:*Keybord click sound will disappear also typing becomes bit difficult.*Thin, I know I mentioned it on pro's as well but it's too thin that it may damage pretty easily.*It didn't fit well at the corners(F12 & arrows), I think it's not with every product I'm just unlucky.If you are someone who uses keyboard alot and likes the sound that magic keyboard makes, please don't go for the keyboard protector because I don't think any other product can fulfill it.If you can compromise over sound and want protect your mac from dust and fluids on the table you can go for this."
4,"I have been using this since last month. I‚Äôm a filmmaker & writer so I have to type a lot. It feels soft and easy to type upon. To what I have a goy in 500‚Çπ is something I believe is a little overpriced. Decrease the price by 150-200‚Çπ and it‚Äôll be worth because, before buying I thought it is quite hard and tactile but it a little softer. Other wise all good, fit is 99% good. There is always a scope of improvement. So keep it up. Cheers."
4,its cover is very useful because of  our surrounding lot of dust & sand particles .it is harmful for keyboard button lot of dust are stored inside button so its not properly working so these cover are useful for protect from them.
5,"Especially in India we have a lot of dust in the air, so it is quite uncomfortable to clean laptop keyboards every now and then. So, I bought this case for my MacBook and it is an awesome fit. I surely recommend everyone to take this for their MacBooks. Great Job by the creators."
5,"The keyboard cover works as perfectly and sits on the keyboard very well. I was wondering if there would be keyboard marks on the screen when I close it, but it doesn't seem to happen.I could still see a very faint mark of the keyboard on the screens, but I think that is bound to happen and that is actually fine (other thick covers might damage the display as Apple says).Overall its a very good product and really good. For the price, maybe the seller could add some cleaning cloth as a freebie to justify the price."
4,Avoid keyboard covers as they create marks on screen which in long term left untreated can cause serious problems. MacBook is designed very precisely and with negligible gaps. So even keyboard cover this thin can cause strain on screen.If you are clumsy and u think that u will spill something on keyboard and u need this then don‚Äôt forget to clean it regularly
1,It does not fit properly.Don‚Äôt waste 300-500 on this.You can see in the pics I attached - the cover is not properly fitting
4,After a lot of search I decided to try this keyboard cover for my m1 macbook airThe cover sits perfectly and key presses don't feel that bad as I expected.I was worried about the small dust particles and this product definitely solves the problem.
2,"Excelllent packaging from amazon, really wow packing but disappointed from product. Just see pics.update: - Thanks amazon I have received a replacement, the replacement product is free from manufacturing defect but not a perfect fit, not a perfect flat... you will have to remove for typing fast.Final - not worth 499/-, ok for 150-200/- as mentioned in another review."
3,"It does serves it's purpose, that is keeping the keypad dust free. Before using this, my mac used to get dirty, specially the keyboard area, but this product solved the problem. It only has one con that, typing becomes a bit difficult when this is on relatively to when it's not. I don't know about other products, if they too cause the same problem. Check that yourself, dear reader ! ( from their reviews )P.S : It's still manageable !"
1,It is very plasticy. If you want to use keyboard u will have to remove it and use. It's simply plastic cut to fit. Should be priced for 200Rs max. My previous macbook's keyboard protector didn't have such quality issue.
4,The product is good and protective. It‚Äôs very thin and one can not realise by just looking if there is cover on the keyboard.Only problem is when you type due to elasticity feel some resistance initially so don‚Äôt have smooth typing experience.
3,"The product is thin and hopefully durableFits well on the keyboard in the middle but is slightly lifted towards the edges. So given that the purpose is to protect from dust collecting on the keyboard and going inside, it would not be doing a good job towards the edges. If you can live with that, then at 499 Rs. it's a decent purchase."
4,"I am using Macbook Air 2020 i3 10thGen. I ordered the transparent one.Most important thing to keep in mind if you start using this, remove it when you close the lid of your lptp, otherwise it might damage screen in long term use.What I liked „Äã„Äã-  matte finish-  perfectly fits on the keyboard.- it sticks to the keyboard while you are typing."
5,"A great product description, helped a lot while decided to buy it. Does everything it says, perfect fit, prevents dust and accidental spills.. doesn't fall off ... Doesn't effect the key responsiveness much. Must say a good value for money product."
5,"I was skeptical about the size and fit. But after long thought, bought it.It fits well on MacBook Air-2020 released model -A2179.It covered all keys except the Touch ID.Super thin (can‚Äôt find a better one).Good one!"
5,It's a good product.I was facing the issue of dust creeping into the gap between the keys. This helps solve it!Mostly you don't even notice that there's a cover on once you use it for a while
1,"The keyboard cover will ruin you whole typing experience/speed, I got a keyboard cover included with my case, would rather use that one as it's much much better than this,.not at all good, please don't buy, rather I would recommend the case, as I purchased that too, it's just 800‚Çπ more than this and you'll get a case, keyboard cover, travkpad guard all included"
5,"Bought this for my MacBook Air M1. Its sleek, transparent, sits flush on the keyboard and feels perfect. The delivery experience was great too. Although I dont support the price to be so high for a thin sheet of silicone but I guess you have to get used to that buying Apple products."
4,It‚Äôs not fully perfect but still the best . Looks good and quality also . When you type u feel little different. Normal use it‚Äôs fine.the rubber layer is so thin and fit precisely for keys
3,"I thought this sheath will be sticking to keyboard but i was totally wrong, Nevertheless but it fits perfectly to it  still i have maintain that it doesn't fall of."
5,It is so transparent n fits so well that u can‚Äôt even figure that there is a cover!!! Though a little expensive but worth.. am happy with the purchase
2,It's fit my mac book air perfectly. But it's too expensive. There is debate about screen damage it seems very thin may not cause damage. It's cost Rs.200 only but I bought it for Rs. 499.
2,"It fits fine on the MACBOOK AIR KeyBoard. Clearly visible all the letters on the keyborad. But the edges of the cover on each key is not soft as it is on the middle of on each key. If we press any key on the edge of a key it won't get pressed. It doesn't let you type fast, really frustrates.OVERALL I WON'T RECOMMEND, IF YOU WANT TO TYPE FAST."
3,It is okayish. Go for it. Quality is above par. It is not sticky. But let's see how it performs over the time. Let's hope it doesn't turn pale yellow.
5,"Fits perfectly. Sits in the macbook slot just fine.A small tip, after application run your finger over all keys with slight pressure (without pressing the key). That will make it sit nicely on the key edges."
5,"It's a very little to the expensive side,but it's ok if you want to save your MAC's keyboards with dust and protecting your keys from stains and patches.It's very sleek that it does feel like it is there or not,it perfectly blends and fits over the keyboard."

5,The skin fits perfect to M1 Macbook . It hugs the keywords really nice and stays firmly on the keyboard. The package came nicely wrapped and the quality is really nice. Definitely worth buying!
5,Amazing product!! Completely worth every penny!! 100% satisfied. Go for it without second thought!!
4,"Nice product, fits the keyboard very well. It's very thin, but doesn't feel like a 500 rupees product.... A thin film of precision cut (with machine) silicon or rubber for 500 rupees is too much"
4,The product does what it is intended to. The fit initially feels not very snug and perhaps this will get better over time.
4,The product is good and does the work however its over priced. Ideally it should not cost more than Rs100!
4,Good. However the thickness could be little more and it would fit on the buttons perfectly.
5,Good fit. I had issues of dust settling into the keyboard or MacBook Air. That got resolved now
3,"This keyboard is built purely for games who are on tight budget but still need that RGB lighting for the show.Well the keys are not properly visible with the LED light beneath.The keycaps and its base are black spray painted which will surely wear-out on long term use. This is not expected on any keyboard of any make and price.The whole keyboard is super lightweight. Good to use if you have the desk pad, else the keyboard will slide as you type.The RGB keyboard is at its best price at the moment but, not up to mark for users looking for build quality, keycap LED transparency and overall durability."
5,Excellent Product... lightning looks amazing...recommended to all üëç
1,worst case product poor quality plastic meterialpoor packingthe product damagedfirst time may i faced amazon product deliveryso upsetplease i give request yo shallerincrease rate no problem but safty cover  otherwise this type of transportation time damage is possibleyou also loss the product and custamer also upset
4,"Pretty much an average membrane keyboard but with lights (which has only one pattern by the way) the default mode is turned off, so when you plug in the keyboard for the first time the light will not glow, you need to turn it on via Scroll Lock key. The keys feel okay an don't make much nosie the input time is okay so if you want a flashy keyboard that has a few advantages in gaming then go for it"
5,very good keyboard with durability and looks both! works good without any faults for now.
5,Looks like devil perfect gaming keyboard
1,"There is no instruction paper along with key board , the lights not working.It is not clear which company sold the product,what is the website address for this company and product.poor quality of support---Yes, i received the support information after the complaint,still, it looks like a secretative organization,no verifiable link address -the reply to mail bounced back-thank you for giving the information,jeyakumar"
2,"Keys have very low travel and are muffy. The backlight is so dim, in a light environment, it will barely be noticeable. Camera photos brighten up the backlight, so I can't show it through photos."
5,"The overall experience is excellent and it's also beautiful but the keys could be farther a bit because while playing if we want to hit on W, we might accidentally click Q, E, or S., but is adjustable and the value of money is great."
1,"1‚òÖ because LED strip is 10/- rs. worth, very dim, keys engraving are barely noticeable.Key quality is very poor, build quality is very poor, lightweight because very less amount of materials used, cable is so thin and poor that it can tear up any time. Everything about this keyboard is poor.Better you go for a 1000/- keyboard.."

5,Good product...Premium look...Good quality..Value for money..Compact in size..Good design
4,It's ok but it's rubber kind a week if you have a good full sized mouse pad then it's ok or you will face some issues.
2,You have to see it from 90 degrees to recognise the keys
1,Received a broken keyboard
1,Don't buy this product. You will be disappointed.

3,"Your Questions Answered :Did you reach here because you love Mechanical keyboards? - This won't make you happy, travel between the keys is less, and accidental key tap can happen Often.Did you reach here because of the backlight keyboard? - This is not for you, wont justify why it's not for you. the backlight situation is BAD.Did you reach here because you are a gamer and you like the way it looks? - Just run from this product, it's not for you nerd..So who is it for?For someone who likes, - Big keyboard cable, - Bad backlight, - OK typing experience.More Reasons to stay away.. - For some reason, the keys are multi-colored, yes it's not RGB, the letters through which the ""white"" light is seen is colored. - The Cable is huge and it takes away the look of your desk. - The backlight is soooo dim. the images are from a totally dark environment, yes it looks all good in pitch dark. but usually, you have a bright monitor in front of the keyboard. and this keyboard is so dim that it looks as if it's about to die.Overall:Usable but Wouldnt recommend.."
1,"- It's not ergonomic in terms of usage.- They keypress is pretty fast. That's about here the good parts end- LED Lighting is more of a fancy piece. Bright lighting and accessibility goes out of the window- To add to after 3 months, the keyboard has stopped working. Complete waste of money"
5,"Arrived in record time.  Very good quality keyboard, and the keys have a nice mechanical feel to them. The material also is quality stuff, and this is a good keyboard for gaming, typing or programming as well, as the pressing action is really smooth.Although not recommended for older people as the letters are very faint, and the backlight is quite dim. Overall a good keyboard for casual gamers and for regular use as well!"
3,"My personal review:-Pros:1. The keys are smooth.2. The touch is premium for the money.3. Feels good to type on it after a little practice.Cons:1. The keys are comparatively small. I had to do a little practice in order to type perfectly with this keyboard since the keys are comparatively smaller than the other generic keyboards and closely packed.2. The backlit in this keyboard is dim, not customizable to your favourite colour and the fact that the keys are individually not painted in white texts, it becomes difficult to type with it when you are typing in a well-lit room."
1,"Just like a regular keyboard, backlight is not that impressive and not bright at all under Rs. 899 price tag. It is just the name ""Gaming Keyboard"" but there is nothing compare to the other available LED boards which are much impressive under this price."
1,1) The box was already opened. Seems to be they delivered somebody's returned product.2) Keyboard having scratches.3) Oneside height adjustment clip missing.4) RGB not working.5) Where is HPs protective cover inside the box?Please do a quality check before delivering the product.
4,"The HP K300 model keyboard is said to be a gaming keyboard, whereas it's not. IT IS NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD FIRST OF ALL. The click feel of this keyboard lies between a normal keyboard and a mechanical keyboard. All I can say is that, if you're purpose is completely based on gaming, do not go for this k300. This is a 25% mechanical and 75% normal keyboard. The only thing which i liked about this product is that the build quality is good.PROS: 1) Good built2) Average click feel3) Has height adjustable stands.4) Good cable and USB INPUT quality.5) Has good cable length.6) Keys are slightly taller from the base which does not hurt while using it for a long time.CONS: 1) Very poor backlit2) The RGB can't be customized.3) No surround RGB.4) Not good to carry around as it's heavier than other keyboards.5) Lock Keys Light is very cheap."
4,"This is for the people who are trying to get a good keyboard but a on budget, people who are also looking to get RGB or get a feeling of mechanical keyboard they can get this model. It does not have any bright RGB lighting it is just namesake. It has a  good build quality, cables are thick, Key strokes are deep to get a better feedback. It has 3 modes to change and it works on Mac and Android also. there is a feature to disable windows accidental keypress in games you can turn it off or on."
2,Poor lights and the keys are very close to each other. The space bar misses hits at times.You will always end up with lot of typos because of the close proximity of the key. HP Gaming Keyboard K500F is a better one.Happy shopping !
4,"The keyboard looks wellbuild..however durability mostly depends on luck; could work for just a couple of weeks or may serve me for years to come...BUT for what it's worth its awesome..I don't quite get why everyone is complaining about the backlight, Yes, it's PERFECTLY READABLY dim (exactly how I would set backlight brightness settings if I was given an option)...keys are comfortable and punchy to type and doesn't skip..no ghosting issues"
5,"A good keyboard is very important for any user. Ive  realized this after i made this purchase. Earlier i used more generic keyboards but this one, for its price, is a game changer. I totally love typing on this keyboard and will suggest this particular keyboard to everyone. For its price you cannot ask for more."
3,"Everything about this keyboard is good , the ergonomics , the feel and feedback ..but the brightness is too low ..can‚Äôt see properly when the room lights are on"
4,"Everything is good.  The feel while typing is great. The travel distance is good. The keyboard is slightly small in width which is a small problem for those whose hands are big like me. The keys don't repeat them, I mean they are accurate. The anti-ghosting feature works well while gaming. Overall it is a decent purchase. Just one little thing to consider is that it's backlight is very very dim. In the daylight conditions, we can see and type, in total darkness, the brightness of keys are enough but the problem comes when we need to type in the evening time, the key prints are invisible(doesn't matter whether the backlighting is off or on). This problem only happens in evening time, other than that, it is great keyboard."
1,"Don't be fooled by the marketing images. Can't change the keyboard light colour to one specific. Brightness is too poor. Without backlight enabled you won't be able to see any key markings clearly. Typing experience is average and nothing much to expect for the price it's being offered.  Can't see keys if there's bright light in front of you, for ex monitor or a well lit room."
4,"The keyboard is pretty amazing for its price but I did notice some rocking while typing which shows it wasn't manufactured right. It just passed the bar for gaming and isn't anything special. No mechanical sound or feel but is better than regular keyboards. I suggest going for cosmicbyte at the same prices for better value. The look is definitely very sleek and minimalistic which is good. The RGB on the other hand sucks, so if ur a big fan of RGB don't buy it. Very old hp product so it's expected but overall ok for its price. I mean it's only 1000."
3,"Key strokes are smooth, sturdy keyboard but bad keyboard base grip and bad key back light. Relied on the bright key board light picture in the product order page and got cheated. Wanted refund but option was available only for replacement. Returned the product and promptly received a replacement which also had very poor backlight. Looks like by design the product has very low back light. Not what I wanted or expected."
5,"Is it me or are the keys a little smaller in width? The key click sounds just like any other membrane keyboard. Surely looks mechanical but not. Lights are exactly like in the pictures. Has breathing mode but the colours don't change around. Overall, not bad."
4,The problem with gaming hardware is that Little things can impact a lot. I didn't like the key typings and the backlight. The backlight is just too low to be allowing someone to play in dark. The key presses don't look comfortable to me a lot. This might vary person to person but do expect a lot more from HP.
5,"1. Built quality superb.2. Keys designs help more to type accurately.3. Weight is also heavy, better than cheap-feeling metal lite keyboards at this price.4. Sounds good too.5. Wire is also bigger and thicker. üòõOnly the backlit could be more, but it suits perfectly as Minimal.It was the best buy for me.And Amazon delivery was awesome too for the fastest delivery within 16 hours."
2,"Good quality, no defects as expected but the backlight is just nothing more than a gimic. It is so dull you have to wait till night turn off all the lights and then you'll notice that it has RGB and even worse is you cannot use it without turning on the RGB cause the letter markings are also very dull. overall if you know to type or know your layout and in a very tight budget sure go for it else I would suggest looking at other bit up tier keyboards.few months later update - yeh please don't buy this keyboard it is not good. spend a bit more a get a better one. lots of issues overtime."
3,Keyboard looks is good specially for gamers but if you are looking for mechanical keyboard or your work mostly based on typing then don't buy this.. first reason is the keys location is not in the right place there are large gaps between keys and you have to set your hand according to this keyboard structure.. and second reason this is not a mechanical keyboard as they are showing in the banner this is membrane keyboard which is not good enough for typist.. I'm giving 3 stars because of 3 reason 1. looks 2. LED light 3. I got this at rs. 825 and there is nothing good in this keyboard..
4,The buttons are absolutely not visible. Backlight is too dull. And I am not exaggerating because I needed a keyboard with not so fancy/bright backlight. This one is okayish I would say. But still the backlight is pretty damn low.
3,"Some keys are near invisible, brightness isn't that good either. Build quality seems good enough. Totally useless if your room is mildly lit, can't even use it in the morning."
5,"I don't write reviews of products generally. But this one, I felt I should write, because I liked how it feels while typing. I type a lot and often, but never tried a gaming keyboard. After trying this keyboard for a few mins, I felt I discovered this keyboard very late.  The make is tough, the backlight is uber cool. There seems to be no doubt that this will last."
5,I choose this cuz I didn't want too fancy looking full RGB aesthetic sorta looking keyboard which the market is dominated with.The board is pretty good though I feel sometimes that the light on keys Could've been a lil more brighter I suppose. But problemo for me.
2,"No ergonomics in this board, key heights are unnecessarily high, left shift key and enter key began squeaking after 11 days of use and the spacebar key has a weird flex to it, athe backlighting is stupid dim. The keys are not printed properly you won't be able to see them even in daylight. Also the worst input lag I've experienced till now of all membrane keyboards."
1,"Most of the keys are giving two output like m/n is giving mn, b/v is giving bv etc. Not at all recommend. I would have given this a negative rating. Total waste of money. Seller also didn't reply to my message. I will never buy from this seller. They sell defective piece."
4,"A very good product, anyone can choose this keyboard for its performance and price, make sure you receive a good product without damage as it can happen due to online shopping, backlight I would say decent enough coz u must understand that a product from reputed company comes out with several plans and ideas behind,so one cannot put all the best in a single product that too for low price,don't miss this price offer, good product to be honest with decent backlight XD"
4,The keyboard is perfect for me aslo looks like the expensive mechanical keyboard. although it is not mechanical but the keys are raised enough... the only thing that bothed me was the compact design. I used to use a standard sized keyboard and shifting to this reduced my speed. also the space bar should be a bit heighted as the other keys hide it and it was difficult to reach for the space bar with my thumb
1,Guys Keyboard is a basic. Led lights on keys are dim even with full brightness. You can strangle to see the keys in darkness. Platform below keys has led. In the Product Ad they have shown bright Led patch that's misleading. It has dimmest led lights trust me. Don't go for it if you are going for Led effects.
4,this keyboard is very well its a good mechanical keyboard at this price range that to from a branded companybut the sad thing is you dont get any option to change the lights or any mods which can change the type the lights are present . this keybpard is for the people who want a cheap mechanical keybpard from a branded company with warranty . and you just gget a option to adjust the brightness of the lights present . thats ityou can go for it . the packaging was good
5,"There are no reviews so far so I thought I could put one. I bought this keyboard for ‚Çπ1500. Trust me you'll never regret buying this keyboard. The blue switch feedback is very satisfying. Such an amazing keyboard for the price. Keycaps are on the little side of lower quality. But again for the price you can't argue more. If this comes under your budget, blindly go for it."
4,I was quite uncomfortable when i bought this because there were no reviews on this product.But still I bought this product because i wanted to support small companies.And you won't beleive that I was damn right..this product turned out to be just what the picture is showing..The quality of keyboard is quite awesome and i am very satisfied.The mouse is also very nice but i could feel something shaking inside it.I will give 5 stars to this if the company contacts me on my email: capbotants@gmail.comi HAVE SOME QUERIES.. COMPANY PLS CONTACT ME ON MY EMAIL ABOVE.
4,"Previously bought cosmic byte gk16 , many keys had different tension and actuation point . This one provides a much more consistent feel across all the keys , the switches provide good feedback and the spacebar is indeed pretty wobbly but isn't a big deal for me . Build quality is pretty good for the price . Overall I'm very satisfied ."
4,Keys feel alright. Not very smooth but smooth enough. Key stabilization is okay for most of the keys but the spacebar is really poor. Very wobbly. Colour effects are sufficient for the price. Feels really solid. Overall satisfied.
5,"Amazing keyboard under 1500/- the quality is also good , blue switch is amazing in this price point"
1,"I was quite skeptical about buying this, but I was quite happy after getting it and using it for a day or so. Even though there is a ghosting problem with the keys 'A' and 'D'.But after 13 days of normal usage, the key 'T' became partially non-functioning/responding (i.e. After pressing it 2 to 3 times it works for once ) but since the 10-day replacement was gone I tried to manage with it. Today it's the 18th day of using this keyboard, more than 7 keys have started to not function or partially function. Now it has been rendered useless.So in short don't go for this just cause it is a cheap mechanical keyboard."
5,PROS:* IT HAS RGB LIGHTING WITH ANTIGOSTING KEYS*IT IS CHEAPER IN MARKET*COMES WITH A NICE MOUSE WHICH IS GREATLY WORKS*IT HAS NICE QUALITY BRAIDED CABLE*GLASS AND METAL FINISH WHICH LOOKS GREATCONS:*THE FONT OF KEYS IN KEYBORD IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND*THERE IS NO DRIVER TO USE MOUSE SECONDARY KEYS AND WE HAVE INSTALL A THIRD PARTY RESOURCE*CANT ABLE TO CHANGE THE LIGHT SETTINGS IN KEYBOARD
4,I have this and another keyboard from other manufacturer with per key rgb but this one definitely feels premium in built quality compared to the other one. The keys are louder then the other blue switch keyboard which I hardly like. Wished they would have released another model with red switchs and rgb customization. Lighting looks subtle and letters on keycaps are visible without backlit. Worth to go for if you get within 1500-1600.
5,"The ONLY thing that one could dislike about this keyboard is the fact that the space bar is a bit wobbly, other than that, there is literally nothing negative about this keyboard; it has a metal top cover, mechanical blue switches that give off a satisfying noise, it's compact, which is good for gaming and I bought it for just 1700. The rgb doesn't really have a lot good combinations but I really can't complain here, all the other keyboards with features like these, would cost you atleast 2,400. If your budget is low and you want to use a mechanical keyboard, just close your eyes and go for this one."
5,Little bit small.  But best in prize
5,"Writing this review with the same keyboard, well while placing the order I was not expecting much quality however to my surprise it came out to be good. keys quality is decent and has a tactile feel to it. if you are an amid typist then probably you may appreciate the typing feel. It is lightweight but feels sturdy however rubber feet could have been better for on desk grip."
5,"This Is one of the most Rugged Gaming Key Board .Looks Very Similar to HPK500F but is 20% Cheaper than HP & Looks Much better & Rugged .Super Built , Awesome Lights , I m not a full time Gamer but love these Illuminating keys.Will Surely Refer to more friends of Mine"
5,Keyboard is amazing ! You can easily clean it ! Most importantly cable is amazing and seems durable compared to all other keyboards used until now !Very comfortable to use.More than I Expected because normally we see when keyboards are good cables are not and vice versa !Lit up amazingly will surely help me to work in the night or in the dark too !
5,"Value for money, brightness, build quality"
1,Worst Worst Worst experience first time....This is the worst experience neither i found the keyboard in the delivered package nor i got resolution for this issue from customer support associate of Amazon. I am shocked as well.
2,"The keyboard is really nice and compact and feels good. I would have kept it only if it would have key rollover support. Left shift and left ctrl and vice versa can't be used together which is a bummer for me, considering I am developer. Other than that keyboard is heavy and has good mechanical feel to it considering it's price range."
5,"This is the photo of the Keyboard , Cocosports Orion K18 . ,This is the awesome keyboard as this is a 10 Key less Keyboard it take Less space and come with breded cable . Connection Type - USB . Come With 7 Different Colour Mode . And price is Budget Friendly . Last but not the least this a Indian Brand . #supportindianbrand"
1,Never buy it they show some thing and u get something else. My package was opened amd it is not grrat for gaming and even the function keys dont work. Please please.... Just..... Dont wate ypur money on this. It doesnt grow on trees if it does them maybe ill buy thiss
2,"After one week fully used the keyboard most keya are stucked example shift ,ctrl,alt keya so returned. Am really disappointed"
5,It's a good mechanical keyboard it's a bang for the buck in 1800rupees keyboard is outstanding and it's LED light is also good
5,Been using it for 2 weeks now and i really like it. Great value for money. Hope it lasts long
5,"Product is absolutely amazing. Totally loved it. Thank you COCO SPORTS . Now all my friends want to buy this combo too .Highly recommend... Worth the price., Kudos!!PS:Fun fact, I am typing using this keyboard right now...."
5,"My first mechanical keyboard and I'm impressed by the value and overall performance from a brand that I had associated with producing cheap disposables. But the betrayal I felt after a couple of dead Logitechs made me consider them instead of always going brand. I'm glad I did!Sensibly priced, no gaudy RGBs or buggy software and an almost ""monolithic"" base that make it easy to clean: RGB ones in the same price range have extra holes/cutouts where dirt could get in, defeating one of the main reason for me to go mechanical. The font prints are awkward but a non-issue for me and the giant ""Zebronics"" logo on the space bar is an easy spray paint fix.I can't really judge the quality of the switch compare to more expensive ones since this is my first foray but I'll update if anything uneventful happens."
5,"Really good for me and pretty good for the price and really feel like a mechanical keyboard, overall a great keyboard for gaming and typing and I was shocked when I opened my package it was a big upgrade from my last keyboard and it is pretty heavy btw the elevation clips don't make a difference to me this keyboard looks like a mechanical keyboardAnd they should have included a wrist rest. I give it a 7 in comfort and make sure to buy a wrist rest with this keyboard."
5,"We are very happy with this keyboard. Amazing keyboard, has an amazing feel & very cool while playing. It was definitely a good decision to buy this product. My son is in love with the keyboard."
5,this keyboard looks like a mechanical keyboardAnd they should have included a wrist rest. I give it a 7 in comfort and make sure to buy a wrist rest with this keyboard.
5,"I found this keyboard to be exactly what I expected. Has a nice weight to it, lots of different color patterns and once the software is installed you can customize the patterns. My favorite thing about it is the satisfying click of the keys. I'm completely pleased with my purchase."
5,"I‚Äôm not a gamer, but I do like a mechanical keyboard when I am typing. This is a very compact keyboard, but it is very heavy and sturdy. I don‚Äôt use the programmable keys so I can‚Äôt tell you anything about them, but I can tell you it is one of the heaviest keyboards I own."
5,if you don't want rgb keyboard but wants a great gaming experience go for itI personally don't like rgb because it is useless and irritating to the eyes. so if you wants a good gaming keyboard under budget go for it
5,My son likes it and enjoys this keyboard playing PC games and doing coding at the university and co-op jobs. Reasonable price. Not too much noise. Good response time. Recommend it.
4,"This is my first mechanical keyboard, after using several membrane keyboards for over 20 years now. I needed something cheap, without RBG lighting, so that I can get something better later when I set up a gaming rig. This one is the best for my needs. I like the clicky sound from the Outemu Blue Switches. I have been using Logitech Mechanical keyboard with Romer G switches at work for about a week now, and the clicky feeling is more in the Outemu Blue switches.So far, the experience with the keyboard is good, and the gaming experience is also decent since this has N key roll over. There is also a hand reset, but if you have a small space to keep the keyboard, it might be an issue. Go for it, if you need a budget mechanical keyboard with full 104 keys and no fancy RBG lighting."
3,"This keyboard has clicky cherry blue switches.Pros:> Typing is a pleasure. The clicky sound feedback is pleasant and helps conform that the key was indeed pressed.> Key switches have a long travel thus typos are avoided due to fat-finger typing.> Enter key is double height which is sorely missing on most other keyboards.> Both Shift keys and the Backspace key are all long ones, perfectly balanced. Our local brand TVSE Gold keyboard has small 'Backspace' key and that was a deal-breaker.> Space-bar key perfectly balanced and not at all wobbly> Has a braided cable with good quality USB connector.> Has a wrist support but it may not be enough for people with large hands> Keyboard footprint is perfect, it does not take up un-necessary desktop space.> Key are raised with easy access for maintenance if needed. This also allows easy dust cleaning beneath keys. (see picture)Cons:> The biggest flaw of this keyboard is the ""Shift+ key functions"" are printed adjoining instead of up and down. So you don't know if you are typing  :  or  ;  (see picture)> Some funky font used for following keys4, 6, 8, 0, o, B, DFor me this is not a big deal as I got used to it in 2 days but can be a deal breaker for others."
1,"For the very first time when i purchased this product i told myself neither i need rgb(cause kids like it) nor i need very strong build i just want best typing and gaming experience that's it and this product delivered that. But things got worse when i received it first in a damaged condition since the plastic used is absolutely cheap and flimsy and can be broken if it just falls from nearly a feet. Ok so i ordered replacement since the product was totally broken from the edge near the escape key confirm from pictures. The day i received replacement i thought that this time i will receive it in a good condition but i was wrong it is still broken and this time from the wrist rest the edge part near the escape key is fine but wrist rest is broken,so definitely i will hurt myself if i type with this. So if u can adjust with the absolute cheap quality definitely go for it. I don't know whom to blame amazon or the seller as i don't know if i got a refurbished product in place of a new one. But getting the product damaged and that too twice is unacceptable so amazon should look into matter i am gonna return it finally and please don't go for cheap mechanical keyboards look for corsair or razer if u want good service support and warranty services. Thanks for reading."
1,"To start, the  Zeb Nitro is neither heavy duty nor good in termss of quality. I'd give a five-star rating to Amazon and a negative rating to the keyboard. Amazon has always been exceptional when it comes to customer service. No issues whatsoever. Going back to the keyboard, the usual click-click sound associated with mechanical keyboardds is not present in Zeb Nitro. The plastic used is extremely flimsy. Similarly, the weight of the keyboard is not the same as mentioned in the ad. On top of everything, I received a damaged item in an open box. I've purchased two keyboards from Zebronics before. Zeb Transformer and Zeb Max Pro. The Zeb max pro is still going strong. I'd undoubtedly recommend the Zeb Max Pro, but not Nitro. Albeit ther is no refund policy with this seller, but Amazon went out of the way in my case and promised me a refund. Great job, Amazon! Finally, Zebronics, you should improve the quality of the Zeb Nitro. Or else, please discontinue this line."
4,This KB is good with the following exceptions...1. The KB font design selection is really very poor (its pathetic IMO)2. Zebronic logo printed on the space bar is a distraction (it should be near the arrow keys or somewhere else but not on the space bar key.).3. If you have a space constraint; there is no option to detach the wrist rest.
5,"Superb quality,easy to use.."
5,Its a small keyboard size of a joystick. But can be used swiftly. Mouse pad and light option all working prompt. I have tried it on my laptop only.
4,Ok good
3,Life is very less

5,Perfect for using Tv
1,Money waste don't buy
5,I like it very much
3,"Its a decent keyboard with backlit RGB. Considering the cost range, I was honestly not expecting state of the art ergonomics or RGB, for the prize range it does provide good value for money. However, you expect product to work atleast for a year without giving issues. For me, many keys did not work as expected after first 3 months. Apart from that, till the time it worked, it was a decent piece."
4,"Update: 2nd May 2019.....Changing rating from 3 to 4 stars. 5 months of gaming usage and it is still working!The product picture showed is not what I received. Two days of usage and the space bar gets stuck time and again. The keys feel very delicate hence this is not for heavy gaming. Perhaps not even casual gaming. Anyways, at this price do not expect a gaming keyboard.Update 8th Dec: Ordered a replacement and received it. Will post the update after using it at least for a week or two.Update 15th Dec: 1 week of gaming usage and the product is still alive. At the price I bought I think 3 stars is a fair rating."
1,"This is one of the cheapest and poorly made products I have come across.Let me tell you why:Pro's:None whatsoever. I would mention the pricing but for this product, that amount is overpriced as well.Con's:Everything people.In short. NEVER GET THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF YOU ARE A CHEAPSKATE!!"
5,I got this keyboard today and at first glance it looks awesome. The typing experience in this keyboard is good and I would recommend every basic user to go for this keyboard without any doubt. The keyboard it a bit flexible but as compared to its price point I can't expect more. The design of the keyboard has been upgraded as shown in thumbnail(just telling because I myself was confused with the pics of old review and the thumbnail)
1,"first time, i  received and packaging not ok, also looks many scratches .second time, i got aa replacement aand thsi keyboard shift keyis horrible and sseveeral  times ssame world is repeating..like this sentence.dont buy it"
5,"Got this Keyboard for Office use, the keyboard is sturdy doesn‚Äôt make noise and didn observe any cons ;If you are working from Home using your laptop I would recommend to get this keyboard or any other keyboard; we tend to type hard sometimes ; laptops are delicate and single key issue would make you run towards a service centre !"
3,"The product I received earlier has some faulty keys. Amazon replaced it very efficiently. The replaced keyboard is working fine most of the times, but there are many occasions where it stops working completely. The USB has to be removed and attached multiple times to make it work. Also it does not have options to change the inclination/height which is a standard feature in most of the keyboards."
2,It felt like a really cheap keyboard although it actually is a cheap keyboard but still the feel while typing or doing any work and the quality of the keys the press nothing was impressive I felt like a better keyboard in a just a little more budget would be far better than this but if I was trip budget then you can go for this you can easily do your work and it won't disappoint you.
5,I received the keyboard in a sealed packing however the mouse pad mention on the box was missing inside the package when opened. I am returning the shipment and expecting a replacement.
4,Good keyboard. Looks cool and durable. Keys are soft. The only problem I see so far is the Ctrl key (See the pic) it misses it's spelling. It's not a big concern but still company should take care of its finishings.
3,"keyboard is awesome but i have use it more than 2 months its alphabets are fating down ,color nikal raha haii , aagar typing ke liya lena hai ti mat lo bekar haii ungliya dard ho jayengii ,gaming ke liya  thik thak haiii but uttna aacha nahii ahii 1k ki price maii aur v aata ahii thoda aur jodka corsear ke keyboard aata haii wahii lo best ahiii gaming aur coding aur typing ke liya best ."
1,What a worst product..Key is jam like using railway station keyboard... Never recommend this keyboard. Your work may reduce to 40% only due to this jam keyboard
5,"Pros:1. Nice Build Quality2. Satisfactory press sound (which you expect from a mechanical keyboard)3. Dimesions are perfectly fine, not like other keyboards which take a lot of space on your table.Cons:No Cons!!!!"
5,"Very smooth around the edges and the keypress.,Prints on key also looks appealing.keys are silent.not a gaming keyboard tho.lets see how long it lasts ."
5,It's a cool keyboard which has soft keys and very responsive to the touch and it's is recommended for editing and typing.Not recommended for gaming.
4,"works fine, few letters came off (not the key itself, but writing on it). Mainly used keys are OK."
1,Worst Product.....The keyboard get failed in three days and even I can't return it now as all I don't have the product cover.Extremely disappointed !!!
1,It doesnt work waste of money. Please dont buy.i bought this on 7 th september and used it for 18days and thus went off. No breakage or any physical damage. Useless cheap boards are maybe i side this.
5,It is a very good keyboards at this price range. Recommended to buy this for those for plan at this budgetCorns. Led of Numb lock  n captions is very deemp
1,Produxt went bad within 1month of purchase and due to pandamic we arr not able to replace as visiting service center will take more time
2,Appearance is good. The functionality is worst. Some keys won't function and some keys repeats if you press once.
4,Quality of keyboard is acceptable in comparison to its price.
5,It is very good with all keys and it works with just a touch..
1,With great hope I have order combo but I have received damaged mouse ...it's very disappointed ...so I return the product and order another one hope I would be getting good quality product.
3,"USB cable is of very poor quality and very thin. But for the price, no complaints. Not suitable for gaming."
4,Low price good quality and good product.
1,"Amount was reasonable, very smooth for handling too may be. But I don't know why the package was not good and safe because when I opened I found two broken pieces of Keyboard. Immediately clicked for a return."
4,Works well. Mouse is very flimsy and not very reliable or sturdy but for the price cant complain
2,Side corner damged Keyboard...  Quality is not that much good and  Z key need to put more pressure to work. Not worthfull for 400
5,Nice Keyboard And Mouse......Really Good Looking.......And Working Fine........Worth The Money
4,"Value for money, but the cable is a bit short of length compared to others, and I had to drag my CPU a bit closer.."
3,Overall keyboard worth the price but switches are not much comfortable and not working smoothly compared to dell/iball/microsoft keyboards. But this is a good product in this price range..!
1,The keys have become so hard. We need to press several times to give the input commands
1,For one click it types more alphabetsSome time keys not functionsWhat to do now return date also overRaw material smells
2,The keyboard start giving issue in 2 mths where the keywords does not work and enters wrongs alphabet
3,Satisfied the product
1,"After 2 months of use, the keys are getting stuck when pressed. Do not buy it."
5,Excellent product
4,First thing is that I didn't received the Mouse Pad with keyboard as said in product title.
3,Well the pictures shows that the product can light up in different colours at once but it has only 3 different times but overall the interference is much better than most
4,Video Player is loading.
4,"Got this for my ASUS TUF F15. It doesn't have any adhesive on it to stick to the laptop keyboard, however it stays on the keyboard covering it from dust from entering inside. Wont fly away that easily, as I had kept my laptop near an Ibell Air Cooler and it stood there despite the wind. Safe to wash, but doesn't seem like it'll last long. The price could've been less."
5,The Keyboard was excellent fit - Grooves provided for each buttons separately. Quite transparent. No need to remove for typing at all. Will certainly reccommend this product.
5,Video Player is loading.
3,1. It is not at all rubbery.2. You won't be able to type as fast as you normally do without the skin.3. It is too costly it is not worth spending over 400rs.4. I would recommend checking local shops because it was delivered very late.5. Not that protective as water or anything can easily get into the keyboard from the sides.6. It makes the keyboard non-clicky.7. I recommend If you can get it under 300rs get it either else search for other options.8. It feels so dry and not at all tactile.
5,Fits well and soft . Prevents dirt from getting inside your Keys
5,This has very good fit for Asus TUF A17 2021 model.Quality is also decent. Has rubber finish .Highly recommend it.
5,Fits the 2021 A15 rtx 3060 eclipse grey variant perfectly
5,i really like this cover . it is simple and well comfort . good quality ü§† product.I am fully satisfied with this item
